Monitoring of Blood glucose levels is one of the important physiological information for medical professionals. Non-invasive detection of blood glucose levels is necessary for monitoring and managing diabetes and reducing the need for frequent finger pricks as invasive methods. Non-invasive measurement of blood glucose provides a convenient and pain-free alternative to traditional invasive methods. The traditional methods require pricking of the finger for taking blood samples and calibration for proper results. Non-calibrated devices can lead to faulty results. In this study, a photo detector-based approach is used to measure the blood glucose level. The system is based on a photodetector sensor that detects the changes in light absorption caused by variations in blood glucose levels. In this study, we performed experiments on two sets of groups, one with normal and the other with fasting state to compare the invasive and non-invasive values of glucose in different subjects to make a standard non-invasive glucometer system. The evaluation was conducted on a group of participants before and after the ingestion of glucose during the procedure. The sensor was placed superficially on the fingertip to acquire the photoplethysmography signal along with the traditional measurement method for reference blood glucose values. The MATLAB-based algorithm has been designed to further filter and process the signal and measure the blood glucose level. The results indicate a strong correlation between photoplethysmography detector-based measurement and the reference blood glucose levels. The non-invasive method exhibited promising accuracy and reliability in estimating blood glucose concentrations. The proposed approach provides a non-invasive measurement of blood glucose level which improves the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.",2151-1411,979-8-3503-0825-9,10.1109/IBCAST59916.2023.10712978,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10712978,Photo detector based glucometer;optical glucometer;Blood sugar diabetes mellitus;noninvasive glucose measure,Correlation;Atmospheric measurements;Fingers;Particle measurements;Photoplethysmography;Glucose;Diabetes;Reliability;Blood;Monitoring,,,,16,IEEE,17-Oct-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To prevent the complication due to diabetics it is essential to monitor the blood glucose level continuously. Most of the regular glucose measurement systems are invasive in nature. Invasive methods cause pain, time consumption, high cost and potential risk of spreading infection diseases. Therefore there is a great demand to have reliable cost effective and comfortable non invasive system for the detection of blood glucose level continuously. The proposed method is based on the direct effect of glucose on the scattering properties of the organ. Glucose decreases the mismatch in refractive index between scatterers and their surrounding media, leading to a smaller scattering coefficient and, consequently, a shorter optical path. The reduction in scattering is due to an increase in glucose concentration. As a result, with the growing concentration of glucose, fewer photons are absorbed and the light intensity increases.

People with diabetes need regular checks of their blood glucose levels to keep track of them and maintain them in healthy ranges. These regular checks are expensive in terms of the consumables being used to perform the tests, i.e., test strips and prick needles, as they are changed every time a test is conducted. Also, the discomfort and pain during the sample collection and the risk of getting an infection are high. This calls for non- invasive methods of blood glucose testing where the test can be done without the need to draw blood. This study uses the Max30102 biosensor, which is a pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor as a non-invasive device to test blood sugar levels by acquiring samples from the patient. The choice of this sensor is informed by studies showing that even during the early stages of diabetes mellitus type 2, there is a change in blood vessels and this in turn affects the pulse rate.

The present intrusive procedure is uncomfortable and unpleasant because users must prick their finger to draw blood for the daily monitoring of blood glucose concentration; as a result, it is not suggested for lifelong use. Due to the lack of glucose measurement machines and the high cost of the procedures, people who live in rural areas and are economically underprivileged do not have access to facilities for routinely checking their blood sugar levels. The 940 nm wavelength has been found to be more accurate at detecting glucose levels. Employing near-infrared spectroscopy, the light passes through the skin which interacts with the chemical constituents of the illuminated tissue to partially absorb and disperse the light. Before reaching optical detectors, light that is not absorbed will be reflected out of the tissue or transmitted through it.

A good number of invasive techniques to measure blood glucose levels have been devised in the past few decades that had been a mixed blessing because it carried multiple limitations along with beneficial sides. Pain, discomfort, and risks of pathogenic infection were some of the basic drawbacks. So, per the demand of time, our main objective of this paper is to introduce a method of blood glucose level measurement that is non-invasive and can overcome the former limitations with better accuracy in a very cost-effective way. Blood glucose concentration can be measured using the PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal. But to gain higher accuracy we need to consider the physiological variations which lead to erroneous measurement of glucose levels. Using GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) sensor data, these perturbations can be minimized. So, in our model PPG sensor and GSR sensor have been used to accurately measure blood glucose levels. Extracted data from these two sensors as well as recorded blood glucose measurement using conventional glucometer were applied in a deep learning algorithm to measure blood glucose level non-invasively.

It causes an irreversible damage to the human organs and even leads to the death. Moreover, for the mortality due to the COVID19, it was found that the death rate of the subjects with the diabetes is higher than that without the diabetes. Therefore, monitoring the blood glucose values is very important. Since the non-invasive blood glucose estimation does not introduce the pain to the subjects and it can reduce the risk of the infection, the non-invasive blood glucose estimation techniques were recently developed. However, it is based on the photoplethysmograms (PPGs). Nevertheless, the PPGs are contaminated by the noise. Hence, performing the denoising is critical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Slant transform based bit plane denoising method to improve the quality of the PPGs. First, the Slant transform is applied to the PPGs. Second, each Slant transform coefficient is represented using a finite number of bits. Third, some bits of the Slant transform coefficients are discarded. Fourth, the inverse Slant transform is applied to the processed PPGs. To perform the blood glucose estimation, the heart rates are extracted from the denoised PPGs and the heart rate variabilities are calculated. They are taken as the features. Then, the feature vectors and the corresponding invasive blood glucose values are used to train a random forest regression model. For the test PPGs, the non-invasive blood glucose values are estimated based on the established model. Compared to the states of the art methods, it is found that our proposed method can effectively improve the ability of estimation.

In the recent years, more and more studies focus on the use of the non-invasive methods to achieve the blood glucose estimation. More and more consumer technology enterprises focusing on human health are committed to implementing accurate and non-invasive blood glucose algorithm in their products. The near infrared spectroscopy built in the wearable devices is one of the common approaches to achieve the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. However, due to the interference from the external environment, these wearable non-invasive methods yield the low estimation accuracy. Even if it is not medical equipment, as a consumer product, the detection accuracy will also be an important indicator for consumers. To address this issue, this paper employs different models based on different ranges of the blood glucose values for performing the blood glucose estimation. First the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are acquired and they are denoised via the bit plane singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Second, the features are extracted. For the data in the training set, first the features are averaged across the measurements in the feature domain via the optimization approach. Second, the random forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the training set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood glucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose values in the same group are employed to build an individual model. Fifth, for each feature, the average of the feature values for all the measurements in the same subset is computed. For the data in the test set, first, the sum of the weighted distances between the test feature values and the average values obtained in the above is computed for each model. Here, the weights are defined based on the importance sorted by the random forest obtained in the above. The model corresponding to the smallest sum is assigned. Finally, the blood glucose value is estimated based on the corresponding model. Compared to the state of arts methods, our proposed method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy.

The long term diabetes increases the risk of the stroke, the heart diseases, the kidney damage and the blindness. Therefore, the blood glucose estimation is crucial for the diabetic patients. The photoplethesmograms (PPGs) can be used for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. In particular, the features were extracted from the PPG represented in both the time domain and the frequency domain. Nevertheless, the total number of the features was very limited. Hence, the performance of the blood glucose estimation was poor. To address this issue, this paper proposes to employ the fractional Fourier transform for extracting the features in the rotated time frequency domain. Since more than one rotational angle can be performed and a set of features can be extracted from each rotational angle, the total number of the features is significantly increased. The computer numerical simulations are conducted.

A dataset has been created by collecting the PPG signal of 30 people along with their blood glucose level, measured in invasive way both before and 2 hours after breakfast. A CNN model has been trained with this dataset to exploit the relationship of glucose level with PPG signal and thus the glucose level of blood have been measured. Results obtained from our system have been compared with corresponding glucose level,recorded in invasive way.",,978-1-7281-5389-6,10.1109/BECITHCON48839.2019.9063187,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063187,Non-invasive;Invasive;PPG signal;Deep learning;Blood glucose,Sugar;Blood;Feature extraction;Diabetes;Sensors;Monitoring;Estimation,,19,,16,IEEE,13-Apr-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Then this PPG signal is passed through a bandpass filter for noise removal and amplification to the microcontroller unit (MCU).

For determining BGL values, the dominant feature of the PPG signal is extracted which has the highest correlation with BGL, and then using regression analysis a relationship is established from which we can measure the BGL values without pricking blood. Finally, correlation analysis is also done to analyze the relationship between HR and BGL.

The paper aims to examine the variation in arterial stiffness at two different points, point A (3 cm above the foot on the posterior tibial artery (PTA)) and point B (on the foot) to facilitate early detection and monitoring of PAD in people with diabetes. A novel non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG) device was developed to acquire signals from the PTA using optical sensors, a microcontroller, and an analog-to-digital converter. Signals were collected from three categories: ‘Healthy and Young (< 40 years, N=20)’, ‘Age matched controls (AMC) (> 40 years, N=20)’, and 'Diabetic and Aged (> 40 years, N=20)‘. The study found consistent pulse wave patterns in healthy subjects but distinct variations in those with diabetes and PAD. In subjects with diabetes, the stiffness index increased from point A to point B. By evaluating pulse signals at multiple points, the study captured arterial property variations at point B caused by PAD, which might not have been evident in single-point analyses. This approach improves the thoroughness of the detection and emphasizes the significance of acquiring signals from multiple points to evaluate arterial health accurately.",2168-9229,979-8-3503-6351-7,10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10785088,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10785088,Arterial stiffness;diabetes;photoplethysmography;multi-point signal evaluation;signal processing;device development,Microcontrollers;Elasticity;Photoplethysmography;Diabetes;Optical sensors;Indexes;History;Arteries;Monitoring;Diseases,,1,,10,IEEE,17-Dec-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This paper presents a high precision near-infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) based noninvasive glucose monitoring System on Chip (SoC). The proposed system implements a fully differential Analog Frontend (AFE) with nonlinear medium Gaussian support-vector-regression (NMG-SVR) for glucose estimation. The AFE design incorporates chopping which enables the reduction of the integrated input-referred current noise to 9.4pArms thus achieving a dynamic range of 115dB. The glucose prediction processor (GPP) removes noise from the PPG signal, extracts ten unique features, and estimates the blood glucose level using a trained customized NMG-SVR model that minimizes the hardware cost by 25%. The extracted features are carefully designed and implemented to ensure inter-feature dependency, which helps to reduce the overall area by more than 40%. Moreover, GPP is implemented using power and clock gating techniques to minimize both static and dynamic power consumption.

This research presents a method for non-invasively monitoring BGL with the help of a powerful controller called the ARM Cortex-M4.

The experimental findings show that the ANN model is quite effective, with an R2 score of 0.986. After careful consideration, the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller's processing capabilities were found to be optimal for running the ANN model.

In order to overcome this, it is urgent to find a method to improve the accuracy by considering skin color and skin thickness.

Blood glucose level (BGL) is usually monitored by collecting a blood sample and assessing the results. This type of measurement is extremely unpleasant and inconvenient for the patient, who must undergo it frequently. This paper proposes a novel real-time, non-invasive technique for estimating BGL with smartphone photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal extracted from fingertip video and deep neural networks (DNN). Fingertip videos are collected from 93 subjects using a smartphone camera and a lighting source, and subsequently the frames are converted into PPG signal. The PPG signals have been preprocessed with Butterworth bandpass filter to eliminate high frequency noise, and motion artifact. Therefore, there are 34 features that are derived from the PPG signal and its derivatives and Fourier transformed form. In addition, age and gender are also included as features due to their considerable influence on glucose. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) feature selection technique has been applied for selecting the best feature set for obtaining good accuracy. Finally, the DNN model has been established to determine BGL non-invasively. DNN model along with the MIC feature selection technique outperformed in estimating BGL with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96, implying a good relationship between glucose level and selected features.

The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful, and uncomfortable for the patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine level based on PPG signal using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1st and 2nd) and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included to feature because of the significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and over-fitting. Finally, DNN based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R2 = 0.922 for Hb, R2 = 0.902 for Gl, and R2 = 0.969 for Cr.

The glucose-induced variations in light intensity from both the non-pulsating and the pulsating part of the reflected optical signal are modeled in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range. The simulation results suggest that it is unlikely to detect the blood glucose based on either the DC or AC component of skin reflected light.

The most common way is through an invasive blood test that causes pain, fear, discomfort and an important economic impact. Recent studies have shown a correlation between heart rate variability (HRV) and glucose levels, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. This research aimed at designing a machine learning algorithm for glucose level detection using HRV features. Methods: We acquired physiological and clinical data from 5, yielding 100 observations. Then, we detected peaks from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and evaluated the peak detection accuracy. Afterwards, we measured multiple HRV-related features from such peaks. Then, data was curated, and relevant features were selected. After that, hyperparameters were optimized for 5 different estimators, and such values were used to create and evaluate predictive models. Results: The PPG peak detection algorithm performed efficiently, with an above 99% precision. The feature selection process yielded 20 features, 65% of them were HRV-related. The best model for glucose level detection was an ensemble between a Support Vector Machine, a Lasso and an Elasticnet model, with a mean absolute error of 16.24 mg/dL. Discussion: HRV features were very important to detect glucose levels. But fatigue, blood pressure and BMI were also included in the final model. We were limited by the size of the dataset, but our results are promising and HRV should be further explored as an indirect way of measuring blood glucose concentration. Additionally, and unlike similar studies in which HRV was measured from medical-grade electrocardiogram equipment, we measured HRV features from a PPG signal obtained using a commercial pulse oximeter. This would allow not only for a non-invasive glucose level measuring, but for it to be performed in a non-clinical setting.",,978-1-7281-4245-6,10.1109/IECBES48179.2021.9398841,CONACYT; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9398841,diabetes;glucose detection;HRV;machine learning;PPG,Pulse oximeter;Pulse measurements;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction;Glucose;Heart rate variability;Blood,,5,,17,IEEE,14-Apr-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Although several attempts have been made to develop wearable non-invasive medical devices, still there is a huge demand to catch the need of resources constrained population. This paper suggests the design of a wearable patch sensor based on Photo Plethysmography (PPG) unit which can be used as a patch sensor or a wearable device for measuring the heart rate of the patient. The device consists of a sensor developed by Maxim Integrated Circuit for acquiring the PPG signal. The heart rate obtained from the PPG device is communicated serially to Arduino Processor using I2C serial communication, also accelerometer is embedded with the system for detecting undesirable hand movement while measuring heart rate from the signal derived from the PPG device. The Arduino Processor is also connected with the blue tooth model for further communication.

Integrated in smartwatches, health patches and finger clips, PPG sensors are widely used in fitness, glucose, blood pressure, and medical monitoring with good user comfort. Integrating PPG in medical chest patches is interesting for COVID-19 patients since it can yield, next to HR and respiration, also SpO2, which traditional ECG-based patches cannot provide. However, measuring PPG/SpO2 on the chest is challenging due to large motion artifacts, small AC/DC perfusion index (PI $\lt 0.1$%), and ambient light. Therefore, it poses a more stringent requirement on dynamic range (DR $\gt 120$ dB) for the PPG readout circuit, while still requiring low power consumption for long battery life. On-chip pinned-photodiodes (PPDs) have been used as passive integrators, resulting in very low power consumption $(2.63 \mu \mathrm{W})$ for the PPG readout [1]. However, the DR and linearity can be limited by the PPDs’ parasitic capacitors. Direct light-to-digital converter (LDC) topologies are proposed in [2 - 4], but their DR is still below 120dB. In [5], a digital-controlled TIA is exploited to control the transimpedance gain, which extends the DR to 130dB while consuming $72 \mu \mathrm{W}$ in the analog front-end (AFE).",2376-8606,978-1-7281-9549-0,10.1109/ISSCC42613.2021.9365757,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9365757,,Power demand;Topology;System-on-chip;Solid state circuits;Sensors;Heart rate variability;Monitoring,,17,,2,IEEE,3-Mar-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Arterial waveform signals from the wrist were obtained and analyzed using Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT). Through ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the signals were decomposed into eight intrinsic mode functions (IMF1-8) of which IMF5 was found to be the desired signal with a discernible diastolic peak. The results showed significant differences in reflection index (RI) and stiffness index (SI) from the young subjects and those from the aged participants with or without diabetes. Significant differences in RI and SI were also noted between subjects with well-controlled diabetes and those without. Good reproducibility and correlation were demonstrated.

Estimation of Blood Pressure and Pulse Transit Time Using Your Smartphone,A. D. Junior; S. Murali; F. Rincon; D.

Therefore, a strong need exists for cost-effective and non-invasive devices that can measure blood pressure (BP) to monitor, diagnose and follow-up patients at risk, but also healthy population in general. One promising method for arterial BP estimation is to measure a surrogate marker of it, such as, Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and derive pressure values from it. However, current methods for measuring PTT require complex sensing and analysis circuitry and the related medical devices are expensive and inconvenient for the user to wear. In this paper, we present a new smartphone-based method to estimate PTT reliably and subsequently BP from the baseline sensors on smartphones. This new approach involves determining PTT by simultaneously measuring the time the blood leaves the heart, by recording the heart sound using the standard microphone of the phone and the time it reaches the finger, by measuring the pulse wave using the phone's camera. Moreover, we also describe algorithms that can be executed directly on current smartphones to obtain clean and robust heart sound signals and to extract the pulse wave characteristics using smartphones. We also present methods to ensure a synchronous capture of the waveforms, which is essential to obtain reliable PTT values with inexpensive sensors. Our experiments show that the computational overhead of the proposed two-phase processing method is minimum, with the ability to reliably measure the PTT values in a fully accurate (beat-to-beat) fashion using directly state-of-the-art smartphones as medical devices.",,978-1-4673-8035-5,10.1109/DSD.2015.90,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302267,blood pressure;pulse transit time;smartphone;ECG;embedded systems;portable medical devices,Phonocardiography;Sensors;Heart;Blood;Calibration;Cameras;Biomedical monitoring,,16,,21,IEEE,26-Oct-15,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Many different TIA topologies have appeared in different optoelectronic fields which make the choice of the best TIA topology for a certain application a challenging task.
