Scopus,1,Non-invasive blood glucose estimation based on fractional Fourier transform,"Diabetes is one of the popular chronic diseases in the world. The long term diabetes increases the risk of the stroke, the heart diseases, the kidney damage and the blindness. Therefore, the blood glucose estimation is crucial for the diabetic patients. The photoplethesmograms (PPGs) can be used for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. In particular, the features were extracted from the PPG represented in both the time domain and the frequency domain. Nevertheless, the total number of the features was very limited. Hence, the performance of the blood glucose estimation was poor. To address this issue, this paper proposes to employ the fractional Fourier transform for extracting the features in the rotated time frequency domain. Since more than one rotational angle can be performed and a set of features can be extracted from each rotational angle, the total number of the features is significantly increased. The computer numerical simulations are conducted. Compared to the method only using the time domain features and the frequency domain features, it is found that the conventional method without the fractional Fourier transform domain features yields 77.2% of all the test data in the Zone A of the grid, respectively. On the other group, our proposed method with the fractional Fourier transform domain features yields 88.6% of all the test data in the Zone A of the grid, respectively. This demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/NNICE61279.2024.10498389,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,3,Blood glucose prediction using non-invasive optical system based on photoplethysmography,"Several people must frequently evaluate their blood glucose since it is an important indicator of health problems mainly diabetes. Different medical systems are commercialized to measure blood glucose levels; some are invasive others are noninvasive. The main purpose of this article is to develop a non-invasive device for measuring blood glucose levels based on the detection and analysis of the photoplethysmogram signal. The developed systems include an optical sensor to detect the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, digitalizing and acquiring boards to a computer and a software program to process and analyze the digitalized PPG signal regarding some features extracted from its waveform. These features are the systolic amplitude Sa and the b/a amplitude ratio in the second derivative PPG (SDPPG) waveform. An invasive glucometer is also used along with the Sa and b/a ratio determined from the developed system to generate a calibration model which is used to deduce blood glucose level (BGL) values. The result showed that the calibration model using the b/a ratio is more accurate for non-invasive blood level measurement then that of Sa with a difference in glucose estimation around 2 mg/dl and with the correlation coefficient (R2) of the glucose level prediction between 0.8904 and 0.9775. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Scopus,4,Non-invasive detection of early microvascular changes in juveniles with type 1 diabetes,"Aims/Hypothesis: The study aimed to assess the usefulness of capillaroscopy and photoplethysmography in the search for early vascular anomalies in children with type 1 diabetes. Methods: One hundred sixty children and adolescents aged 6–18, 125 patients with type 1 diabetes, and 35 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. We performed a detailed clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, nailfold capillaroscopy, and photoplethysmography. Results: Patients with diabetes had more often abnormal morphology in capillaroscopy (68.60%, p = 0.019), enlarged capillaries (32.6%, p = 0.006), and more often more over five meandering capillaries (20.90%, p = 0.026) compared to healthy controls. Meandering capillaries correlated with higher parameters of nutritional status. In a photoplethysmography, patients with diagnosed neuropathy had a higher percentage of flow disturbance curves (p < 0.001) with a reduced frequency of normal curves (p = 0.050). Conclusions: Capillaroscopic and photoplethysmographic examinations are non-invasive, painless, fast, and inexpensive. They are devoid of side effects, and there are no limitations in the frequency of their use and repetition. The usefulness of capillaroscopy and photoplethysmography in the study of microcirculation in diabetic patients indicates the vast application possibilities of these methods in clinical practice. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",10.1186/s12933-023-02031-y,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,5,Blood Glucose Monitoring Using Non-Invasive Features of Wearable Devices and Machine Learning,"With the increasing number of people with diabetes and the popularity of wearable devices, it becomes a novel research direction to use sensor data from wearable devices to monitor blood glucose in healthy people. There are many methods used for blood glucose prediction, such as using NIR and PPG for accurate blood glucose prediction, however, these data are usually not easy to acquire, and using data from wearable devices may be a potential direction. In this paper, two methods were proposed using the latest dataset released by Physiconet in 2023, 1-D CNN and tsfresh, for feature extraction of sensor data, and then construct a GRU network to predict blood glucose values, comparing the effectiveness of the two methods. Besides, the effects of different sensor features on the prediction results are explored. The study shows that the features extracted by tsfresh can follow the trend of blood glucose changes well, but it is still far from predicting specific blood glucose value. A larger dataset is needed to make a conclusion on the feasibility of the study.  © 2024 ACM.",10.1145/3654823.3654897,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,6,Multi-View Cross-Fusion Transformer Based on Kinetic Features for Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Measurement Using PPG Signal,"Noninvasive blood glucose (BG) measurement could significantly improve the prevention and management of diabetes. In this paper, we present a robust novel paradigm based on analyzing photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The method includes signal pre-processing optimization and a multi-view cross-fusion transformer (MvCFT) network for non-invasive BG assessment. Specifically, a multi-size weighted fitting (MSWF) time-domain filtering algorithm is proposed to optimally preserve the most authentic morphological features of the original signals. Meanwhile, the spatial position encoding-based kinetics features are reconstructed and embedded as prior knowledge to discern the implicit physiological patterns. In addition, a cross-view feature fusion (CVFF) module is designed to incorporate pairwise mutual information among different views to adequately capture the potential complementary features in physiological sequences. Finally, the subject-wise 5-fold cross-validation is performed on a clinical dataset of 260 subjects. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of BG measurements are 1.129 mmol/L and 0.659 mmol/L, respectively, and the optimal Zone A in the Clark error grid, representing none clinical risk, is 87.89%. The results indicate that the proposed method has great potential for homecare applications.  © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/JBHI.2024.3351867,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,7,Prospective Assessment of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multi-site Photoplethysmography Pulse Measurements for Diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Disease in Primary Care,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with cerebral and coronary artery disease. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of people over 55 years; many more have asymptomatic PAD. Early detection enables modification of arterial disease risk factors. Diagnostically, assessment of symptoms or signs can be unreliable; ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) testing is time-consuming and few healthcare professionals are properly trained. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG), an alternative non-invasive test for PAD, in primary care. PAD patients identified from general practice registers were age- and sex-matched with controls. Participants were assessed using MPPG, ABPI and duplex ultrasound (DUS). Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of MPPG and ABPI (relative to DUS) and concordance. MPPG test results were available in 249 of 298 eligible participants from 16 practices between May 2015 and November 2016. DUS detected PAD in 101/249 (40.6%). MPPG sensitivity was 79.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.9–87.6%), with specificity 71.9% (95% CI 63.7–79.2%). ABPI sensitivity was 80.2% (95% CI 70.8–87.6%), with specificity 88.6% (95% CI 82–93.5%). With comparable sensitivity to ABPI, MPPG is quick, automated and simpler to do than ABPI; it offers the potential for rapid and accessible PAD assessments in primary care. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/00033197221121614,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,8,Analyzing RGB and HSV Color Spaces for Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Level Estimation Using Fingertip Imaging,"Traditional blood glucose measurement methods, including finger-prick tests and intravenous sampling, are invasive and can cause discomfort, leading to reduced adherence and stress. Non-invasive BGL estimation addresses these issues effectively. The proposed study focuses on estimating blood glucose levels (BGL) using “Red-Green-Blue (RGB)” and “Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color spaces” by analyzing fingertip videos captured with a smartphone camera. The goal is to enhance BGL prediction accuracy through accessible, portable devices, using a novel fingertip video database from 234 subjects. Videos recorded in the “RGB color space” using a smartphone camera were converted into the “HSV color space”. The “R channel” from “RGB” and the “Hue channel” from “HSV” were used to generate photoplethysmography (PPG) waves, and additional features like age, gender, and BMI were included to improve predictive accuracy. To enhance the precision of blood glucose estimation, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to identify the most significant and optimal features from the large set of features. The “XGBoost”, “CatBoost”, “Random Forest Regression (RFR)”, and “Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)” algorithms were applied for blood glucose level (BGL) prediction. Among them, “XGBoost” yielded the best results, with an R2 value of 0.89 in the “RGB color space” and 0.84 in the “HSV color space”, showcasing its superior predictive ability. The experimental outcomes were assessed using “Clarke error grid analysis” and a “Bland-Altman plot”. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that only 7.04% of the BGL values fell outside the limits of agreement (±1.96 SD), demonstrating strong agreement with reference values. © (2025), (Science and Information Organization).

Scopus,9,Design and Validation of a Monte Carlo Method for the Implementation of Noninvasive Wearable Devices for HbA1c Estimation Considering the Skin Effect,"To diagnose diabetes early or to maintain stable blood glucose levels in diabetics, blood glucose levels should be frequently checked. However, the only way to check blood glucose levels regularly is to use invasive methods, such as pricking the fingertip or using a minimally invasive patch. These invasive methods pose several problems, including being painful and potentially causing secondary infections. This study focuses on noninvasively measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using PPG signals. In particular, the study relates to a method and a hardware design technology for removing noise that may be present in a PPG signal due to skin contact with a noninvasive HbA1c measurement device. The proposed HbA1c measurement device consists of the first sensor (PPG sensor) module including an optical barrier and the second sensor (cylindrical sensor) module for removing the skin effect. We have developed a Monte Carlo method to implement accurate, noninvasive HbA1c measurement by considering different skin properties among different subjects. Implementing this model in wearable devices will allow end users to not only monitor their glycated hemoglobin levels but also control diabetes with higher accuracy without needing any blood samples. This will be a groundbreaking advancement in modern wearable medical devices. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/mi15091067,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,10,NOVEL MULTI-MODAL OBSTRUCTION MODULE FOR DIABETES MELLITUS CLASSIFICATION USING EXPLAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a persistent metabolic disorder which is characterized by increased blood glucose level in the blood stream. Initially, DM occurs while the insulin secretion in the pancreas has a disability to secrete or to use hormone for the metabolic process. Moreover, there are different types of DM depending on the physiological process, and the types include Type1 DM, Type2 DM and Gestational DM. Electrocardiography (ECG) waves are used to detect the abnormal heartbeats and cannot directly detect DM, but the wave abnormality can indicate the possibility and presence of DM. Whereas the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are a non-invasive method used to detect changes in blood volume that can monitor BG changes. Furthermore, the detection and classification of DM using PPG and ECG can involve analyzing the functional performance of these modalities. By extracting the features like R wave (W1) and QRS complex (W2) in the ECG signals and Pulse Width (S1) and Pulse Amplitude Variation (S2) can detect DM and can be classified into DM and NonDM. The authors propose a Novel architecture in the basis of Encoder Decoder structure named as Obstructive Encoder Decoder module. This module extracts the specific features and the proposed novel Obstructive Erasing Module remove the remaining artifacts and then the extracted features are fed into the Multi-Uni-Net for the fusion of the two modalities and the fused image is classified using EXplainable Machine Learning (EX-ML). From this classification the performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and AUC can be determined. © 2024, Polish Association for Knowledge Promotion.

Scopus,12,An LSTM-Based Model for Non-invasive Blood Glucose Prediction Utilizing BVP Signals,"Diabetes is a severe and long-lasting metabolic condition, and the effective management depends on continuous monitoring and control of blood glucose levels. However, traditional invasive methods, such as fingertip blood sampling, cause inconvenience and discomfort to patients, resulting in reduced compliance and motivation for diabetes management. Furthermore, these methods increase the risk of infection due to frequent blood sampling. Therefore, this research aims to develop a non-invasive model for predicting glucose levels based on blood volume pulse (BVP) signals. These devices employ Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technique that monitors changes in blood volume due to periodic heartbeats, to acquire BVP signals. By leveraging machine learning, specifically the long short-term memory network (LSTM), our model thoroughly processes, cleans, segments, and extracts features from these signals. Our approach enables not only real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels but also the prediction of future glucose trends, crucial for timely medication adjustments and disease management. Experimental results reveal that our LSTM model significantly outperforms traditional RNN and linear regression models in predicting blood glucose levels within clinically acceptable ranges. This study offers a more convenient and accurate method for diabetic patients to monitor their blood glucose levels, thereby enhancing their overall health management.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Scopus,15,Accuracy of a Non-Invasive Home Glucose Monitor for Measurement of Blood Glucose,"Introduction: Patients with diabetes mellitus monitor their blood glucose at home with monitors that require a drop of blood or use a continuous glucose monitoring device that implants a small needle in the body. However, both cause discomfort to the patients which may inhibit them for regular blood glucose checks. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensing technology is an approach for non-invasive blood glucose measurement and PPG sensors can be used to predict hypoglycaemic episodes. InChcek is a PPG-based non-invasive glucose monitor. However, its accuracy has not been checked yet. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of InCheck, a non-invasive glucose monitor for the estimation of blood glucose. Methods: In a tertiary care hospital, patients who came for blood glucose estimation were tested for blood glucose non-invasively on the InCheck device and then by the laboratory method (glucose oxidase-peroxidase). These two readings were compared. We used International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15197:2013 (95% of values should be within ± 15 mg/dL of reference reading if reference glucose <100 mg/dL or within ± 15% of reference reading if reference glucose ≥100 mg/dL and 99% of the values should be within zones A and B in consensus error grid), and Surveillance Error Grid for analyzing the accuracy. Results: A total of 1223 samples were analyzed. There was a significant difference between the reference method glucose level (135 [Q1-Q3: 97-179] mg/dL) and monitor-measured glucose level (188.33 [Q1-Q3: 167.33-209.33] mg/dL) (P < 0.0001). A total of 18.5% of readings were following ISO 15197:2013 criteria and 67.25% of coordinates were within zone A and zone B of the consensus error grid. In the surveillance error grid analysis, about 29.4% of values were in the no-risk zone, 51.8% in slight risk, 18.6% in moderate risk, and 0.2% were in the severe risk zone. Conclusion: The accuracy of the InCheck device for the estimation of blood glucose by PPG signal is not following the recommended guidelines. Hence, further research is necessary for programming or redesigning the hardware and software for a better result from this optical sensor-based non-invasive home glucose monitor. © 2024 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",10.4103/ijem.ijem_36_23,YES,Unique DOI

The study group included 203 convalescents aged 60.0 (55.0–63.0) and 115 (56.7%) women. The ASCVD risk was assessed as low to moderate to very high based on medical history (for 62 participants with pre-existing ASCVD/diabetes/chronic kidney disease in the entire cohort) or calculated in percentages using the Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) algorithm based on age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure (BP), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for 141 healthy participants). The stiffness index (SI) and reflection index (RI) measured by photoplethysmography, as well as pulse pressure (PP), calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BP, were markers of arterial stiffness. Stiffness parameters increased significantly with the increase in ASCVD risk in the entire cohort. In 30 (14.8%) patients in the low- to moderate-risk group, the median SI was 8.07 m/s (7.10–8.73), RI 51.40% (39.40–65.60), and PP 45.50 mmHg (40.00–57.00); in 111 (54.7%) patients in the high-risk group, the median SI was 8.70 m/s (7.40–10.03), RI 57.20% (43.65–68.40), and PP 54.00 mmHg (46.00–60.75); and in 62 (30.5%) patients in the very-high-risk group, the median was SI 9.27 m/s (7.57–10.44), RI 59.00% (50.40–72.40), and PP 60.00 mmHg (51.00–67.00). In healthy participants, the SI ≤ 9.0 m/s (sensitivity of 92.31%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.686, p < 0.001) based on the receiver operating characteristics was the most sensitive variable for discriminating low to moderate risk, and PP > 56.0 mmHg (sensitivity of 74.36%, AUC 0.736, p < 0.001) was used for discriminating very high risk. In multivariate logistic regression, younger age, female sex, PP ≤ 50 mmHg, SI ≤ 9.0 m/s, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL had the best relationship with low to moderate SCORE2 risk. In turn, older age, currently smoking, PP > 56.0 mmHg, RI > 68.6%, and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg were related to very high SCORE2 risk. In conclusion, arterial stiffness is significantly related to ASCVD risk in post-COVID-19 patients and can be helpful as a single risk marker in everyday practice. Cut-off points for arterial stiffness parameters determined based on SCORE2 may help make individual decisions about implementing lifestyle changes or pharmacological treatment of ASCVD risk factors © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/life14091105,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,18,Smartphone photoplethesmogram based noninvasive blood glucose estimation via fractional singular spectrum analysis based super-resolution Fractional singular spectrum analysis based super-resolution,"Diabetes mellitus, as an incurable chronic disease, is a medical problem worldwide. At present, there is no effective cure for diabetes, only frequent monitoring to control blood glucose levels. Previous detection methods mainly rely on fingertip puncture to obtain blood samples, which is not only painful but also highly susceptible to infection for patients. Therefore, the use of non-invasive methods to monitor blood glucose has broad prospects and important significance. Nevertheless, the features used for estimating the blood glucose values cannot be extracted accurately from the denoised photoplethesmograms (PPG) when the sampling rate of the PPGs is too low. To address this issue, this paper proposes the fractional singular spectrum analysis (SSA) based super-resolution method to generate the PPGs with the high equivalent sampling rate from those with the low sampling rate. Since the fractional SSA operation is nonlinear and adaptive, this super-resolution method is nonlinear and adaptive. To obtain the estimated blood glucose values, both the conventional detrending algorithm and the SSA bit plane denoising method are applied to the PPGs. Second, both the heart rate variability features of the processed PPGs are extracted. Finally, the blood glucose values are estimated via the random forest regression model. Compare to the results obtained based on the PPGs without performing the super-resolution, it is found that more features can be extracted after performing the super-resolution. As a result, the estimation performances based on the super-resoluted PPGs are better.  © 2023 ACM.",10.1145/3650400.3650421,YES,Unique DOI

Currently, the most widely accepted method for glucose monitoring is invasive, however, despite its great reliability, it can be uncomfortable and traumatizing for the youngest users. The objective of this study is to provide an alternative method that allows a non-invasive estimation of blood glucose levels with an elevated level of confidence. In this work, 187 records were performed on people without any declared pathology; the concentration of blood glucose and the amplitude of the PPG signals of 525 nm, 660 and 940 nm were measured simultaneously. 70% of the data was used to train a regression model based on a fine Gaussian support vector machine, while the remaining 30% is used to validate the results.

Considering the mutual endothelial insult leading to similar undesirable peripheral hemodynamic perturbations, hypertension (HT) may blunt this classification performance. Second derivative PPG (SD-PPG) indices were derived from the second derivative of the PPG signal. The variables of interest were the previously described peaks of the initial positive (a), early negative (b), re-increasing (c), late re-decreasing (d), diastolic positive (e) and negative (f) waves and the ratios between them. Patients were classified according to their type 2 DM and hypertension phenotypes. SD-PPG indices were compared between diseased subgroups, healthy controls and also dichotomous classification performance was evaluated. Two SDPPG indices, b/a ratio and the vascular ageing index (VAI = (b-c-d-e)/a) responded to isolated DM type 2 (n = 29) amongst healthy subjects (n = 106) (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.629 p = 0.034 and 0.631 p = 0.031 20 respectively). However, the classification performance became insignificant with the inclusion of HT patients (n=30). (p = 0.839 vs. p = 0.656).

Utilizing wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) with machine learning to estimate HbA1c can be a promising method for non-invasive HbA1c monitoring in diabetic patients. This study aims to develop a HbA1c estimation system based on machine learning algorithms using PPG signals obtained from the wrist. We used a PPG based dataset of 22 subjects and algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boost (CatBoost) and random forest (RF) to estimate the HbA1c values. Note that the AC-to-DC ratios for three wavelengths were newly adopted as features in addition to the previously acquired 15 features from the PPG signal and a comparative analysis was performed between the performances of several algorithms. We showed that feature-importance-based selection can improve performance while reducing computational complexity. We also showed that AC-to-DC ratio (AC/DC) features play a dominant role in improving HbA1c estimation performance and, furthermore, a good performance can be obtained without the need for external features such as BMI and SpO2. These findings may help shape the future of wrist-based HbA1c estimation (e.g., via a wristwatch or wristband), which could increase the scope of noninvasive and effective monitoring techniques for diabetic patients. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/s23167231,YES,Unique DOI

This invasive method is not capable of continuously monitoring a diabetic patient's blood glucose levels and can be painful and inconvenient in the long term. In our study, we developed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation method using dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with pulse arrival velocity (PAV). The dual-channel PPG was chosen based on the advantages of 530 nm PPG in blood flow measurement and 1550 nm infrared light in blood glucose concentration detection. In addition to testing various amplitude features in PPG at different fiducial points (systolic peak, dicrotic notch, and diastolic peak), we also examined the amplitude ratio between the two PPG channels (530 nm green-light PPG and 1550 nm infrared PPG), as well as PAV, for noninvasive blood glucose estimation. In this study, we recruited 18 healthy subjects (14 males and four females; aged 29.4 ± 7.87 years old). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) experiment was conducted on each participant to manipulate the blood glucose level. Each parameter for blood glucose estimation was examined using partial F-test to assess its impact on blood glucose estimation.

However, its potential as a painless marker of blood glucose concentration remains to be explored. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of perfusion index (PI) in estimating blood glucose using conventional and ultrasound-assisted finger photoplethysmography (PPG) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range. Method: A customized module combining a reflective PPG sensor with a peak emission wavelength of 940 nm and an ultrasonic sensor with an operating frequency of 40 kHz was developed. 4-min PPG recordings (two minutes with ultrasound; two minutes without ultrasound) were acquired from 53 volunteers, including 19 diabetic patients, after conventional blood sample collection via an invasive glucometer. We computed Pearson's coefficient (r), the mean absolute error (MAE), Bland-Altman plots, and Clarke error grids to explore the relationship between PI and glucose values and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, with and without ultrasound. Results: When ultrasonic waves were applied, PI showed a higher correlation with blood glucose levels (r = −0.90, p < 0.001), MAE significantly decreased (p = 0.0051), the bias was slightly closer to zero, the LOA interval became narrower, and predicted glucose levels deviating from reference values by more than 20 % decreased in number.

First, these four channel PPGs form a quaternion valued signal. Then, the quaternion valued means and the quaternion valued medians of this quaternion valued PPGs are employed as features. Next, the quaternion valued long short term memory (QLSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed for estimating the non-invasive blood glucose values. Unlike the traditional methods based on extracting the features in each channel of the PPGs independently and fusing all the features together in the conventional neural networks, the quaternion valued operations performed on the quaternion valued PPGs only fuse the same features among these four channels together while do not fuse different features among these four channels together.

TSA converts the 1D inputs into 2D representations, grouping the adjacent points into a single 2D token. It then generates dynamic patches and feeds them into a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) network, optimizing the learning on different attention areas. HDformer achieves state-of-the-art results (sensitivity 98.4, accuracy 97.3, specificity 92.8, AUC 0.929) on the standard MIMIC-III dataset, surpassing existing research. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end solution where a low-cost wearable is prototyped to connect with the HDformer in the Cloud via a mobile app. This scalable, convenient, and affordable approach provides instantaneous detection and continuous monitoring for individuals.

DSCNet’s performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD), and coefficient of determination (R2), yielding values of 3.022, 0.05, 0.058, 0.062, 10.81, and 0.98, respectively. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/s25061868,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,39,Development of a Non-Invasive Machine-Learned Point-of-Care Rule-Out Test for Coronary Artery Disease,"The current standard of care for coronary artery disease (CAD) requires an intake of radioactive or contrast enhancement dyes, radiation exposure, and stress and may take days to weeks for referral to gold-standard cardiac catheterization. The CAD diagnostic pathway would greatly benefit from a test to assess for CAD that enables the physician to rule it out at the point of care, thereby enabling the exploration of other diagnoses more rapidly. We sought to develop a test using machine learning to assess for CAD with a rule-out profile, using an easy-to-acquire signal (without stress/radiation) at the point of care. Given the historic disparate outcomes between sexes and urban/rural geographies in cardiology, we targeted equal performance across sexes in a geographically accessible test. Noninvasive photoplethysmogram and orthogonal voltage gradient signals were simultaneously acquired in a representative clinical population of subjects before invasive catheterization for those with CAD (gold-standard for the confirmation of CAD) and coronary computed tomographic angiography for those without CAD (excellent negative predictive value). Features were measured from the signal and used in machine learning to predict CAD status. The machine-learned algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 59%. The rule-out profile was maintained across both sexes, as well as all other relevant subgroups. A test to assess for CAD using machine learning on a noninvasive signal has been successfully developed, showing high performance and rule-out ability. Confirmation of the performance on a large clinical, blinded, enrollment-gated dataset is required before implementation of the test in clinical practice. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/diagnostics14070719,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,40,Enhanced Non-Invasive Diabetes Classification with Effective Photoplethysmogram Signal Features for Future Point-of-Care Diagnostics,"The global diabetes point-of-care (POC) biosensor market has seen substantial growth, driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the demand for non-invasive glucose monitoring technologies. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal analysis has emerged as a promising method for non-invasive diabetes detection, offering a cost-effective and user-friendly alternative to traditional glucose monitoring systems. This study explores the potential of PPG signal features for enhancing the accuracy of diabetes classification using machine learning models. By focusing on key features such as Mean Inter-Beat Interval (IBI), Standard Deviation of NN Intervals (SDNN), Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD), Length Max to Rastio, and Spectral Entropy, the study aims to improve the reliability of non-invasive diabetes detection methods. The study evaluated three machine learning models: LightGBM (LGBM), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results demonstrate that LGBM achieved the highest accuracy of 98.86%, followed by RF with 96.59%, and SVM with 89.77%. These findings suggest that PPG signal analysis, combined with robust machine learning techniques, holds significant potential for advancing non-invasive diabetes monitoring technologies, offering a more accessible and effective solution for early detection and continuous monitoring.  © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ICSMech62936.2024.10812288,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,41,Toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease,"Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease in which narrowing of arteries reduces blood flow to the lower limbs. PAD is common; it is estimated to affect 236 million individuals worldwide. Advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and concomitant cardiovascular disease are common factors associated with increased risk of PAD. Complications of PAD can include claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore clinically important to use diagnostic tests that accurately identify PAD. Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression or intervene when indicated. Toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are amongst a suite of non-invasive bedside tests used to detect PAD. Both TBI and TSBP are commonly utilised by a variety of clinicians in different settings, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy is warranted and highly relevant to inform clinical practice. Objectives: To (1) estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities. Secondary objectives were to investigate several possible sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including the following: patient group tested (people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with renal disease and general population), type of equipment used, positivity threshold and type of reference standard. Search methods: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc and DARE databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 27 February 2024. Selection criteria: We included diagnostic case-control, cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective studies in which all participants had either a TSBP or TBI measurement plus a validated method of vascular diagnostic imaging for PAD. We needed to be able to cross-tabulate (2 x 2 table) results of the index test and the reference standard to include a study. To be included, study populations had to be adults aged 18 years and over. We included studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Studies had to use TSBP and TBI (also called toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI)), either individually, or in addition to other non-invasive tests as index tests to diagnose PAD in individuals with suspected disease. We included data collected by photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and manual or automated digital equipment. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently completed data extraction using a standardised form. We extracted data to populate 2 x 2 contingency tables when available (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Where data were not available to enable statistical analysis, we contacted study authors directly. Two review authors working independently undertook quality assessment using QUADAS-2, with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We incorporated two additional questions into the quality appraisal to aid our understanding of the conduct of studies and make appropriate judgements about risk of bias and applicability. Main results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. Thirteen of the studies used colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) as a reference standard, two used computed tomography angiography (CTA), one used multi-detector row tomography (MDCT), one used angiography and one used a combination of CDU, CTA and angiography. TBI was investigated in 1927 participants and 2550 limbs. TSBP was investigated in 701 participants, of which 701 limbs had TSBP measured. Studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard. The certainty of evidence according to GRADE for most studies was very low. Authors' conclusions: Whilst a small number of diagnostic test accuracy studies have been completed for TBI and TSBP to identify PAD, the overall methodological quality was low, with most studies providing a very low certainty of evidence. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is therefore limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. Future research using robust methods and clear reporting is warranted to comprehensively determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the TBI and TSBP for identification of PAD with greater certainty. However, conducting such research where some of the reference tests are invasive and only clinically indicated in populations with known PAD is challenging. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Scopus,42,MMG-net: Multi modal approach to estimate blood glucose using multi-stream and cross modality attention,"In the context of effective disease management for hyperglycemia patients, regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is imperative. However, traditional glucose monitoring methods suffer from invasiveness, discomfort, and potential infection. This paper introduces an innovative approach that utilizes non-invasive data sources derived from wearable devices, namely Photoplethysmography (PPG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), in combination with user-provided food logs. The proposed model, MMG-Net, uses the three waveforms along with food features extracted from food logs to estimate blood glucose levels. MMG-Net delivers exceptional performance metrics, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 13.51 mg/dL, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 12.57 %, and a Root Mean Square Error of 17.26 mg/dL. Notably, MMG-Net outperforms existing solutions in the estimation of blood glucose levels, solidifying its status as an innovative approach. The model's clinical precision is substantiated through Clarke Error Grid analysis, with a remarkable 99.43 % of predictions falling within clinically acceptable ranges.

Scopus,43,Noninvasive Blood Glucose Detection System With Infrared Pulse Sensor and Hybrid Feature Neural Network,"The rising prevalence of diabetes increases the demand for daily blood glucose (BG) detection, necessitating the urgent development of noninvasive BG detection systems. To enhance the convenience of BG monitoring, we employed infrared pulsed sensing (IPS) to capture photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG signals effectively reflect changes in blood volume within the human body, providing rich information about BG. In this article, we designed a BG detection system based on an IPS and a deep hybrid feature neural network. By deploying IPS and deep learning algorithms on a Raspberry Pi, the system is equipped with data collection, analysis, prediction, and display capabilities for real-time BG monitoring. Previous studies relying on shallow machine learning for BG detection struggled to capture the complex underlying correlations between PPG signals and BG. Our proposed deep hybrid feature neural network model, DCC-Net, achieves end-to-end BG prediction by capturing different temporal and spatial features in PPG signals. The F2M fusion module combines multiscale and multilevel features, effectively modeling the intricate nonlinear relationship between PPG signals and BG, thereby improving classification performance. We recruited 290 participants and used IPS to collect PPG signals, constructing an IPS-PPG dataset. Testing DCC-Net on the IPS-PPG dataset yielded an impressive overall classification accuracy of 0.92, demonstrating its high accuracy. Furthermore, our model showed good generalization performance on the publicly available dataset PPG-BP. The proposed approach exhibits significant potential for advancing research and development in noninvasive BG detection systems.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/JSEN.2024.3373048,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,44,Predictors for Vulnerable Plaque in Functionally Significant Lesions,"Background: Vulnerable plaque presents prognostic implications in addition to functional significance. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify relevant features of vulnerable plaque in functionally significant lesions. Methods: In this multicenter, prospective study conducted across 5 countries, including patients who had invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80, a total of 95 patients with available pullback pressure gradient (PPG) and plaque analysis on coronary computed tomographic angiography and optical coherence tomography were analyzed. Vulnerable plaque was defined as the presence of plaque rupture or thin-cap fibroatheroma on optical coherence tomography. Among the 25 clinical characteristics, invasive angiographic findings, physiological indexes, and coronary computed tomographic angiographic findings, significant predictors of vulnerable plaque were identified. Results: Mean percentage diameter stenosis, FFR, and PPG were 77.8% ± 14.6%, 0.66 ± 0.13, and 0.65 ± 0.13, respectively. Vulnerable plaque was present in 53 lesions (55.8%). PPG and FFR were identified as significant predictors of vulnerable plaque (P < 0.05 for all). PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70 were significantly related to a higher probability of vulnerable plaque after adjustment for each other (OR: 6.75 [95% CI: 2.39-19.1]; P < 0.001] for PPG >0.65; OR: 4.61 [95% CI: 1.66-12.8]; P = 0.003 for FFR ≤0.70). When categorizing lesions according to combined PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70, the prevalence of vulnerable plaque was 20.0%, 57.1%, 66.7%, and 88.2% in the order of PPG ≤0.65 and FFR >0.70, PPG ≤0.65 and FFR ≤0.70, PPG >0.65 and FFR >0.70, and PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70 (P for trend < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Among low-FFR lesions, the presence of vulnerable plaque can be predicted by PPG combined with FFR without additional anatomical or plaque characteristics.

Scopus,45,EMD-Based Noninvasive Blood Glucose Estimation from PPG Signals Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Effective management of diabetes requires accurate monitoring of blood glucose levels. Traditional invasive methods for such monitoring can be cumbersome and uncomfortable for patients. In this study, we introduce a noninvasive approach to estimate blood glucose levels using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We have focused on blood glucose prediction using wrist PPG signals and explored various PPG waveform-based features, including AC to DC ratio (AC/DC) and intrinsic mode function (IMF)-based features derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been found using EMD-based features to estimate blood glucose levels noninvasively. Additionally, feature importance-based selection has also been used to further improve the accuracy of the proposed model. Among the four machine learning algorithms considered in this study, CatBoost consistently outperformed XGBoost, LightGBM, and random forest across a wide number of features. The best performing model, CatBoost, achieved Pearson’s r of 0.96, MSE 0.08, (Formula presented.) score 0.92, and MAE 8.01 when considering the top 50 features selected from both PPG waveform-based features and IMF-based features. The p-values for all models were <0.001, indicating statistically significant correlations. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of noninvasive blood glucose monitoring using advanced machine learning techniques. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/app14041406,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,46,Noninvasive In Vivo Estimation of HbA1c Based on the Beer–Lambert Model from Photoplethysmogram Using Only Two Wavelengths,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the most important factor in diabetes control. Since HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding three months, it is unaffected by a patient’s activity level or diet before a test. Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complications associated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography is helpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths (615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two different ratio calibrations were applied and their performances were compared to a work that used three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson’s r values for HbA1c estimates were 0.896 and 0.905, considering the ratio calibrations for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibration in addition to the ratio calibrations, we could improve this performance such that the Pearson’s r values of the HbA1c levels were 0.929 and 0.930 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. In a previous study, using three wavelengths, the Pearson’s r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Here, the RCF of the (Formula presented.) estimation was 0.986 when the (Formula presented.) ratio calibration was applied, while in a previous study, the RCF values of the (Formula presented.) estimation were 0.983 and 0.986 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Thus, we have shown that HbA1c estimation using only two wavelengths has a comparable performance to previous studies. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/app13063626,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,47,PPG based Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring using Multi-view Attention and Cascaded BiLSTM Hierarchical Feature Fusion Approach,"Diabetes is a chronic disease with exponential growth and poses significant challenges to global healthcare. Regular blood glucose (BG) monitoring is key for avoiding diabetic complications. Traditional BG measurement techniques are invasive and minimally invasive, causing pain, discomfort, cost, and infection risks. To address these issues, we developed a noninvasive BG monitoring approach on photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using multi-view attention and cascaded BiLSTM hierarchical feature fusion approach. Firstly, we implemented a convolutional multi-view attention block to extract the temporal features through adaptive contextual information aggregation. Secondly, we built a cascaded BiLSTM network to efficiently extract the fine-grained features through bidirectional learning. Finally, we developed a hierarchical feature fusion with bilinear polling through cross-layer interaction to obtain higher-order features for BG monitoring. For validation, we conducted comprehensive experimentation on up to 6 days of PPG and BG data from 21 participants. The proposed approach showed competitive results compared to existing approaches by RMSE of 1.67 mmol/L and MARD of 17.88%. Additionally, the clinical accuracy using Clarke error grid (CEG) analysis showed 98.80% of BG values in Zone A+B. Therefore, the proposed approach offers a favorable solution in diabetes management by noninvasively monitoring the BG levels. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/JBHI.2024.3464098,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,48,Design and Development of Dual Point Photoplethysmography Device for Assessing Impact of Diabetes on Arterial Stiffness,"Arterial stiffness is a condition that results from the thickening and loss of elasticity in arterial walls, commonly observed in subjects with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The paper aims to examine the variation in arterial stiffness at two different points, point A (3 cm above the foot on the posterior tibial artery (PTA)) and point B (on the foot) to facilitate early detection and monitoring of PAD in people with diabetes. A novel non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG) device was developed to acquire signals from the PTA using optical sensors, a microcontroller, and an analog-to-digital converter. Signals were collected from three categories: 'Healthy and Young (< 40 years, N=20)', 'Age matched controls (AMC) (> 40 years, N=20)', and 'Diabetic and Aged (> 40 years, N=20)'. The study found consistent pulse wave patterns in healthy subjects but distinct variations in those with diabetes and PAD. In subjects with diabetes, the stiffness index increased from point A to point B. By evaluating pulse signals at multiple points, the study captured arterial property variations at point B caused by PAD, which might not have been evident in single-point analyses. This approach improves the thoroughness of the detection and emphasizes the significance of acquiring signals from multiple points to evaluate arterial health accurately. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/SENSORS60989.2024.10785088,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,49,Safety of bilateral arm pressure measurements in the diagnostic workup of dialysis-associated steal syndrome,"Objective: Although bilateral brachial pressure measurement is routinely included in the diagnostic work-up of upper extremity ischemia, it is generally avoided in the presence of hemodialysis access due to fears of inducing access thrombosis. This study evaluated the safety of bilateral brachial pressure measurement in patients with clinical suspicion of dialysis-associated steal syndrome (DASS). Methods: Patients undergoing non-invasive testing for steal syndrome between September 2015 and December 2021 were included in this study. The diagnostic workup was performed by certified vascular sonographers in an outpatient vascular lab and consisted of bilateral brachial pressures, photoplethysmography, and duplex ultrasonography of the access. Interarm differential (IAD) was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the contralateral arm minus SBP in the access arm. The primary endpoint was immediate access thrombosis. Results: The study sample consisted of 331 subjects with a mean age of 61 ± 13 and a median access age of 9 months (3–31 months) with radiocephalic fistulas present in 29%. Many patients (68%) presented with paresthesia and 4% presented with tissue loss. The mean brachial systolic pressure was 152 ± 37 mmHg on the ipsilateral arm versus 143 ± 34 mmHg on the contralateral (p-value <0.001), with an inter-arm differential (IAD) of −8.4 ± 19 mmHg. A total of 16 subjects (5%) presented a differential ⩾20 mmHg. A positive thrill was noted in all the accesses immediately following blood pressure measurement and no occurrence of access thrombosis was noted at 30 days. Proximal arterial revascularization interventions were performed in 11 cases (3%). Subjects who presented an IAD ⩾20 mmHg had lower ipsilateral digital-brachial index (0.39 ± 0.18 vs 0.68 ± 0.26; p = 0.037), a higher tendency of being referred for angiograms (37.5% vs 10.5%, p = 0.006), and more proximal arterial revascularization procedures (25.0% vs 2.2%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Bilateral arm pressure measurement in the context of dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS) appears safe and useful for identifying subjects whose symptoms are due to proximal arterial inflow disease. We therefore recommend this test be considered in the diagnostic algorithms of DASS. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/11297298231212226,YES,Unique DOI

Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising modality for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. In this study, we investigate how blood glucose levels can be measured using PPG signals. To do this, we analyze a largescale dataset from VitalDB, which includes information from 6,388 subjects. By including diverse patient profiles in our dataset, we ensure that our models can be applied to a wide range of individuals.

Factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes significantly affect cardiovascular health by damaging blood vessels and increasing heart strain. It measured HbAIc, FBG, Lipid profile, and calculation BMI. Using the Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) method, which requires complex equipment and expertise, PPG offers a simpler alternative. By analyzing Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and Digital Pulse Wave (DPW) amplitude after induced blood flow increase (reactive hyperemia), PPG serves as a non-invasive measure for evaluating vascular health, indicating early signs of cardiovascular problems.

At present, computer algorithms have been widely used in the classification and prediction of diabetes, and have shown great application value in clinical aspects, the aim of this study was to use a noninvasive approach to simultaneously extract the main weight amplitude ratio sequence of the pulse signal (PPG) and the RRI sequence of ECG, and the coincidence rate between them was calculated by percussion entropy algorithm for the classification of diabetes. In this experiment, the synchronous principal weight amplitude ratio sequences and RRI sequences of healthy subjects (Group 1: 30 people) and diabetic subjects (Group 2: 28 people) were extracted, and the anastomoses between them were calculated using PEn. The normal physiological parameters of the human body and PEn were tested using an independent-sample T-test and Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, the multi-scale cross-approximate entropy (MCAE) was compared with PEn. The results show that $\operatorname{PEn}(\mathbf{p}\lt 0.001)$ distinguished diabetic patients from healthy individuals in a way that was both considerably distinct and superior to MCAE ($\lt 0.05$), and PEn was negatively correlated with both glycosylated hemoglobin ($r=-0.451, p\lt 0.001$) and fasting blood glucose ($r=-0.359, p\lt 0.001$). Not only do the results of this study indicate that the percussion entropy of subject weight ratio sequence and RRI sequence is superior in predicting the vascular health status of diabetes, but they also indicate that the principal weight amplitude ratio sequence and RRI sequence can be used as characterization parameters for diabetes, demonstrating certain research significance for the early screening of diabetes. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/IPEC61310.2024.00113,YES,Unique DOI

The present technique for minimal invasive BGL monitoring involves taking a small blood sample and transferring it to a glucometer. However, this procedure can be uncomfortable for the patient. This research presents a method for non-invasively monitoring BGL with the help of a powerful controller called the ARM Cortex-M4.

Signal processing and feature extraction are carried out using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. To predict the BGL, two ML models are developed: one employing a Linear Regression (LR) model and the other an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The experimental findings show that the ANN model is quite effective, with an R2 score of 0.986. After careful consideration, the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller's processing capabilities were found to be optimal for running the ANN model.

Photoplethysmography (PPG), a photosensitive method that detects blood volume variations, has shown promise for non-invasive glucose monitoring. Deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to PPG signals can predict BGLs with high accuracy. However, training DNN models requires large and diverse datasets, which are typically distributed across multiple healthcare institutions. Privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions further limit data sharing, making conventional centralized machine learning (ML) approaches less effective. To address these challenges, this study proposes a federated learning (FL)-based solution that enables multiple healthcare organizations to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw patient data, thereby enhancing model performance while ensuring data privacy and security. In the data preprocessing stage, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to smooth PPG signals and remove baseline drift. Adaptive cycle-based segmentation (ACBS) is then used for signal segmentation, followed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection, optimizing classification accuracy. The proposed system was evaluated on diverse datasets, including VitalDB and MUST, under various conditions with data collected during surgery and anesthesia. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.1 mg/dL, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) confirmed the model’s clinical reliability, with 99.31% of predictions falling within clinically acceptable limits. The FL-based approach outperformed conventional deep learning models, making it a promising method for non-invasive, privacy-preserving glucose monitoring. © 2025 by the authors.",10.3390/bios15040255,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,57,Non-invasive blood glucose estimation using a novel white-box model: An interpretable machine learning approach,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal analysis by machine learning (ML) algorithms is a promising development in the field of non-invasive blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring. In this work, we report a comprehensive set of protocols to estimate BGL from the raw PPG time-series. The protocol is trained on 1153 distinct entries. Pre-processing was done using Kalman smoothing for noise reduction, wavelet-based baseline correction, and the AMPD algorithm for automatic trough detection. The protocol includes extensive feature extraction of 392 features including single pulse area-based features of which 26 features were determined as statistically significant. Of the various machine learning (ML) models trained on these features, the Voting regressor performed best, yielding an R2 value of 0.921. We further trained a human interpretable (novel white-box) model using PySR which also yielded a remarkably high R2 value of 0.815. Importantly, the study demonstrates successful feature reduction, showing that even with a smaller set of features, predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and clinical relevance (as demonstrated by Clarke Error Grids, 90% and 70% in zone A for black and white-box models respectively) remain largely unaffected. The white-box model in non-invasive BGL estimation significantly enhances interpretability, making it highly suitable for clinical applications where transparency and reliability are crucial. © 2025",10.1016/j.bspc.2025.107520,YES,Unique DOI

If untreated in the initial stage, diabetes-related problems such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiac complications arise in the body. It must be detected early in order to receive proper treatment, which can prevent the condition from progressing to severe complications. This study proposed a non-invasive type 2 diabetes classification system using short PPG signals through various machine learning (ML) techniques.

Scopus,61,Fusion of various optimisation based feature smoothing methods for wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"The traditional blood glucose estimation method requires to take the invasive measurements several times a day. Therefore, it has a high infection risk and the users are suffered from the pain. Moreover, the long term consumable cost is high. Recently, the wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation approach has been proposed. However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the presence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the obtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable. Moreover, different subjects have different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose. To address this issue, a polynomial fitting approach to smooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values has been proposed. In particular, the design of the coefficients in the polynomial is formulated as the various optimisation problems. First, the blood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimisation approaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood glucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimisation approach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each optimisation approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each sorted blood glucose value, the optimisation method corresponding to the minimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate probability of each selected optimisation method is computed. If the accumulate probability of any selected optimisation method at a point is greater than a threshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected optimisation methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted blood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries points being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after performing the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose values in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose values and the corresponding optimisation methods in these regions are determined. It is worth noting that the conventional lowpass denoising method was performed in the signal domain (either in the time domain or in the frequency domain), while the authors’ proposed method is performed in the feature space or the reference blood glucose space. Hence, the authors’ proposed method can further improve the reliability of the obtained feature values or the reference blood glucose values so as to improve the accuracy of the blood glucose estimation. Moreover, the individual modelling regression method has been employed here to suppress the effects of different users having different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose values. The computer numerical simulation results show that the authors’ proposed method yields the mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) at 0.0930 and the percentage of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid at 94.1176%. © 2023 The Authors.

Scopus,64,Improvement of Non-invasive Glucose Estimation Accuracy through Multi-wavelength PPG,"Effective diabetes management requires regular and accurate blood glucose monitoring; however, traditional invasive methods often cause discomfort and inconvenience. Non-invasive techniques such as photoplethysmography (PPG) have been explored, though single-wavelength PPG systems are limited by the overlapping absorption characteristics between glucose and other biological components, such as water and fat. In this study, a novel multi-wavelength PPG system integrated with temperature and humidity sensors is introduced, coupled with a neural network framework featuring attention mechanisms to enhance glucose prediction. The system employs six optical sensors covering wavelengths from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, enabling deeper tissue penetration and enhanced glucose specificity by targeting distinct absorption peaks—especially those above 1000 nm. The system was validated using a robust dataset of 26,063 measurements from 254 participants. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, with the model achieving 86.49% compliance with the ISO 15197: 2013 standards and 91.80% of measurements falling within Zone A of the Parkes error grid. The introduction of multiple wavelengths clearly improves performance over single-wavelength systems, and wavelengths above 1000 nm were shown to have a higher contribution in glucose prediction. In addition, the incorporation of temperature and humidity data also enhanced performance by accounting for environmental and physiological factors, and that demographic and meal-related factors significantly impact prediction accuracy, thereby underscoring the potential of this system as a reliable, non-invasive, and personalized glucose monitoring tool. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/JBHI.2025.3556666,YES,Unique DOI

In line with this objective, this study is an effort for waveform analysis of autonomic response of photo pulse plethysmogram (PPG) and to evaluate PPG features that may provide better non-invasive detection of the disease. A total of 300 (150 diabetic and 150 control) subjects aged more than 18 years are considered for this study. Relevant patient details were obtained, and finger PPG recording in digital form was performed for 5 min with the digitization sampling rate of 200 sample points per second. After signal baseline correction, features are calculated from averaged normalized PPG and its first and second derivatives. A total of 41 features were derived from normalized PPG pulse and its derivatives for the assessment of hyperglycemia.

Scopus,69,Study on Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Detection Technology Based on Time Frequency Domain Analysis; [基于时频域综合分析的无创血糖检测技术研究],"The non-invasive blood glucose detection technique is an indirect method of measuring glucose levels in the blood, which is safe, fast, and non-invasive without damaging human tissues, breaking the limitations of traditional blood glucose detection, and has important research value. The photoplethysmography signal, containing various physiological and pathological information, is widely used in various clinical studies and is also the focus of attention in the current implementation of the noninvasive glucose detection technique. Current studies of non-invasive blood glucose detection based on photoplethysmography signals have only considered the contribution to system modelling when the time or frequency domains act alone. Although the time domain analysis of the signal can describe the variation of the PPG signal amplitude with time, it cannot visually reflect the energy distribution of the PPG signal frequency. Therefore, the signal analysis of a single domain cannot fully express the PPG signal, which leads to information loss. When using frequency domain analysis to extract the signal spectrum, it is necessary to use all the time domain information of the signal, which is a global transformation and may result in the loss of signal characteristics at a specific time or in a specific frequency band. In summary, this paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on the integrated time-frequency domain analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG), using a parallel time-frequency domain method to consider the association between the photoplethysmography signal and blood glucose, a cluster analysis method is used to extract representative waveforms in the time domain of the PPG signal, analyze the correlation between the waveform features and blood glucose, and determine the time domain feature parameters of the waveform. On this basis, the pulse waveform time domain signal is converted to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform, and the spectral information is studied using principal component analysis to establish the frequency domain characteristic quantities. The BP neural network-based non-invasive blood glucose detection model is constructed by extracting the time-frequency domain feature parameters from the waveform signals obtained through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and using the invasive blood glucose concentration detected in real time as a reference. At the same time, in order to improve the accuracy of the model and achieve model optimization, a genetic algorithm is applied to the model for the second correction, and the final MAE and RMSE of the test set reach 1. 13 and 1. 42 mmol • L 1. The results of Parker's CEG show that the prediction results in the A and В regions accounted for 80. 3% and 19. 7% , respectively, which indicates that the method has good prediction accuracy and provides a theoretical basis for the feasibility of daily non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. It is beneficial to improve the detection and monitoring systems for diabetes, to judge the condition better comprehensively, and to prevent, guide, and treat diabetes promptly. © 2024 Science Press.

Scopus,71,NON-INVASIVE PPG-BASED ESTIMATION OF BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL,"This paper focuses on non-invasive blood glucose determination using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals, which is crucial for managing diabetes. Diabetes stands as one of the world’s major chronic diseases. Untreated diabetes frequently leads to fatalities. Current self-monitoring techniques for measuring diabetes require invasive procedures such as blood or bodily fluid sampling, which may be very uncomfortable. Hence, there is an opportunity for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring through smart devices capable of measuring PPG signals. The primary goal of this research was to propose methods for glycemic classification into two groups (low and high glycemia) and to predict specific glycemia values using machine learning techniques. Two datasets were created by measuring PPG signals from 16 individuals using two different smart devices – a smart wristband and a smartphone. Simultaneously, the reference blood glucose levels were invasively measured using a glucometer. The PPG signals were preprocessed, and 27 different features were extracted. With the use of feature selection, only 10 relevant features were chosen. Numerous machine learning models were developed. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel performed best in classifying PPG signals into two groups. These models achieved an accuracy of 76% (SVM) and 75% (RF) on the smart wristband test dataset. The functionality of the proposed models was then verified on the smartphone test dataset, where both models achieved similar accuracy: 74% (SVM) and 75% (RF).

Scopus,73,Imaging Heart Rate Detection Method Based on Clustering and Adaptive Filtering; [基 于 聚 类 和 自 适 应 滤 波 的 成 像 式 心 率 检 测 方 法],"Objective In recent years, since heart rate is one of the most important indicators of cardiovascular health, non-contact heart rate measurement methods are highly attractive and popular in daily life. Non-contact imaging photoplethysmography (IPPG) has caught much attention from biomedical researchers due to its non-invasive properties without the need for high-performance hardware devices. However, during non-contact imaging where subjects are less constrained, IPPG measurement results are susceptible to interference from rigid and non-rigid movements such as head turning, smiling, speaking and eyebrow raising, and unstable lighting. For improving the IPPG technique, we propose a region of interest (ROI) selection method with a concave lens deformation algorithm and skin color pixel clustering, and an adaptive normalized least mean square (NLMS) filtering algorithm for blood volume pulse (BVP). The proposed method improves accurate ROI extraction in less constrained conditions and the performance of filtering out non-physiological signal intensity fluctuations in ROI. Meanwhile, it has advantages in accuracy and stability under motion scenes and environments with large illumination variations, holding potential significance for non-contact heart rate monitoring in telemedicine, indoor fitness, psychological testing, and unmanned vehicles. Methods We obtain the subjects heart rates by processing the facial video images. First, the facial skin color region is distorted and expanded by adopting the concave lens deformation algorithm to increase the percentage of the skin pixel region. Next, the K-means++ clustering algorithm selects skin pixels again and builds RGB channels to estimate BVP signals. Subsequently, the chrominance-based color space projection decomposition (CHROM) algorithm is applied to pre-denoise the above-mentioned BVP signal. Finally, the proposed adaptive NLMS algorithm is employed to filter out the interference of background light, and then measure heart rate by spectrum analysis. In subsequent experiments, ablation experiments are conducted on the UBFC-rPPG dataset to verify that the improved ROI dynamic extraction method can enhance the accuracy of heart rate detection. In comparison experiments, on the same dataset, the results prove that the proposed method possesses stronger robustness to color signal fluctuations caused by the subject s head movements and facial expressions. Additionally, the results of the lighting fluctuation experiment where the light intensity of the doublearm lamp is continuously adjusted to simulate the changing light scene demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and Discussions In ablation experiments, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the improved ROI extraction method with a concave lens deformation algorithm and clustering algorithm amounts to 4.29 beats per minute (min-1), and the standard deviation (SD) is 2.59 min-1, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.19% and the Pearson correlation coefficient r of 0.66. Our improved ROI selection method achieves the optimum in all the above-mentioned indexes. Integrated with the concave lens deformation algorithm and clustering algorithm, the proposed improved ROI dynamic extraction method can improve the accuracy of heart rate detection in less-constrained conditions (Table 1). The MAE of the proposed method is 0.92 min-1, MAPE is 1.57%, SD is 2.43 min-1, and r is 0.65 for the comparison experiments in motion scenarios, which is better than other unsupervised methods. Compared to the supervised learning methods, our method has advantages with low MAE and SD without the necessity for pre-learning and training (Table 2). Additionally, our proposed method has smaller confidence intervals, which means that the study is more robust to color signal fluctuations induced by head movements and facial expressions of the subjects (Fig. 5). In the experiments with drastic lighting changes, the proposed method still possesses smaller MAE, MAPE, and SD than others. The proposed adaptive NLMS method has been proven to be significantly feasible and effective in scenarios with varying lighting conditions (Table 3). By conducting Bland-Altman analysis, the bias of our proposed method is minimal with 95% confidence interval in the -7.8 min-1 to 7.8 min-1 (Fig. 6). Obviously, it indicates that our method is more robust in removing non-physiological signal fluctuations caused by illumination fluctuations. Conclusions To deal with the interference caused by normal physiological motion and ambient light in the IPPG technique, we propose an ROI dynamic extraction method integrated with the concave lens deformation algorithm, K-means++ clustering algorithm, and an adaptive NLMS algorithm on the BVP signals to improve the heart rate measuring stability and accuracy of this technique. Firstly, the concave lens deformation algorithm is adopted to compress facial features in each image frame, which in turn increases the pixel area of the facial skin ROI. Secondly, the K-means++ clustering method is employed to resieve the facial skin regions, build the ROI rich in physiological signals, and generate BVP signals with high signal-to-noise ratios. Thirdly, the CHROM algorithm is utilized to filter out the lighting interference caused by normal physiological motion, such as head movements and facial expressions, and further obtain first-filtered BVP signals.

Scopus,75,Non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using PPG signals with various deep learning models and implementation using TinyML,"Accurate and continuous blood glucose monitoring is essential for effective diabetes management, yet traditional finger pricking methods are often inconvenient and painful. To address this issue, photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising non-invasive alternative for estimating blood glucose levels. In this study, we propose an innovative 1-second signal segmentation method and evaluate the performance of three advanced deep learning models using a novel dataset to estimate blood glucose levels from PPG signals. We also extend our testing to additional datasets to assess the robustness of our models against unseen distributions, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the models’ generalizability and specificity and accuracy. Initially, we analyzed 10-second PPG segments; however, our newly developed 1-second signal segmentation technique proved to significantly enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The selected model, after being optimized and deployed on an embedded device, achieved immediate blood glucose estimation with a processing time of just 6.4 seconds, demonstrating the method’s practical applicability. The method demonstrated strong generalizability across different populations. Training data was collected during surgery and anesthesia, and the method also performed successfully in normal states using a separate test dataset. The results showed an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 19.7 mg/dL, with 76.6% accuracy within the A zone and 23.4% accuracy within the B zone of the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (CEGA), indicating a 100% clinical acceptance.

Scopus,76,Pulse Power Generation Chronoamperometry as an Advanced Readout for (Bio)sensors: Application for Noninvasive Diabetes Monitoring,"We propose pulse power generation (PPG) amperometry as an advanced readout realized for Prussian blue (PB)-based (bio)sensors. In contrast to the conventional power generation mode, when the current response is generated upon continuous short-circuiting, the suggested pulse regime is fulfilled by periodic opening and shorting of the circuit. Despite PB being electroactive, the pulse readout is advantageous over conventional steady-state power generation, providing up to a 15-fold increased signal-to-background ratio as well as dramatically improved sensitivity exceeding 10 A·M-1·cm-2 for H2O2 sensors and 3.9 A·M-1·cm-2 for glucose biosensors. Such analytical performance characteristics are, most probably, achieved due to the enrichment of the diffusion layer by analyte mass transfer from the bulk upon opening of the circuit. Due to an improved sensitivity-to-background ratio, reduced flow-rate dependence, and enhanced operational stability, the regime allows reliable monitoring of blood glucose variations through sweat analysis with the on-skin device. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05746,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,82,Predicting Arterial Stiffness from Single-Channel Photoplethysmography Signal: A Feature Interaction-Based Approach,"Arterial stiffness (AS) serves as a crucial indicator of arterial elasticity and function, typically requiring expensive equipment for detection. Given the strong correlation between AS and various photoplethysmography (PPG) features, PPG emerges as a convenient method for assessing AS. However, the limitations of independent PPG features hinder detection accuracy. This study introduces a feature selection method leveraging the interactive relationships between features to enhance the accuracy of predicting AS from a single-channel PPG signal. Initially, an adaptive signal interception method was employed to capture high-quality signal fragments from PPG sequences. 58 PPG features, deemed to have potential contributions to AS estimation, were extracted and analyzed. Subsequently, the interaction factor (IF) was introduced to redefine the interaction and redundancy between features. A feature selection algorithm (IFFS) based on the IF was then proposed, resulting in a combination of interactive features. Finally, the Xgboost model is utilized to estimate AS from the selected features set. The proposed approach is evaluated on datasets of 268 male and 124 female subjects, respectively. The results of AS estimation indicate that IFFS yields interacting features from numerous sources, rejects redundant ones, and enhances the association. The interaction features combined with the Xgboost model resulted in an MAE of 122.42 and 142.12 cm/sec, an SDE of 88.16 and 102.56 cm/sec, and a PCC of 0.88 and 0.85 for the male and female groups, respectively.

Scopus,85,“The peripheral perfusion index discriminates haemodynamic responses to induction of general anaesthesia”,"Induction of general anaesthesia is often accompanied by hypotension. Standard haemodynamic monitoring during anaesthesia relies on intermittent blood pressure and heart rate. Continuous monitoring systemic blood pressure requires invasive or advanced modalities creating a barrier for obtaining important information of the circulation. The Peripheral Perfusion Index (PPI) is obtained non-invasively and continuously by standard photoplethysmography. We hypothesized that different patterns of changes in systemic haemodynamics during induction of general anaesthesia would be reflected in the PPI. Continuous values of PPI, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated in 107 patients by either minimally invasive or non-invasive means in a mixed population of surgical patients. 2 min after induction of general anaesthesia relative changes of SV, CO, and MAP was compared to the relative changes of PPI. After induction total cohort mean(± st.dev.) MAP, SV, and CO decreased to 65(± 16)%, 74(± 18)%, and 63(± 16)% of baseline values. In the 38 patients where PPI decreased MAP was 57(± 14)%, SV was 63(± 18)%, and CO was 55(± 18)% of baseline values 2 min after induction. In the 69 patients where PPI increased the corresponding values were MAP 70(± 15)%, SV 80(± 16)%, and CO 68(± 17)% (all differences: p < 0,001). During induction of general anaesthesia changes in PPI discriminated between the degrees of reduction in blood pressure and algorithm derived cardiac stroke volume and -output. As such, the PPI has potential to be a simple and non-invasive indicator of the degree of post-induction haemodynamic changes. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10877-023-01035-z,YES,Unique DOI

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a helpful technique that can be used to measure blood-glucose concentration without a blood sample. To facilitate such noninvasive in-vivo estimation, we propose a model based on the Beer-Lambert law for measuring blood-glucose concentration using the PPG signal. Notably, only two wavelengths are used. First, the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is estimated from the ratio of absorbance at two wavelengths, then another absorbance ratio is presented, and the blood-glucose concentration is estimated by substituting the SpO2 estimated earlier to this ratio. The PPG signals from 40 subjects were collected along with their reference blood-glucose concentrations and SpO2 values. The PPG-based blood-glucose concentrations are then calculated using mathematical equations derived from the Beer-Lambert law. A supervised machine learning model, XGBoost, is applied to calibrate the estimation model with the reference values measured using a commercial device; according to our experimental results, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) value is 0.85.

There is a need for early diagnosis and risk stratification to implement an overall risk management strategy. Presently, the conventional method is not suitable for large-scale screening. The primary aim of this study is to develop an automated diagnostic system that uses Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals for the non-invasive diagnosis of hypertension and DM-II. The proposed model uses a statistical feature extracted by decomposing the PPG signal up to level 11 into a sub-band using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a variety of classifiers are used for the classification of hypertension and detection of DM-II patients.

However, this enhancement came at the cost of requiring an additional HbA1c measurement, thus being unfriendly to users. In this study, the enhanced HbA1c NIBG deep learning model (blood glucose level predicted from PPG and HbA1c) was trained with 1494 measurements, and we replaced the HbA1c measurement (explicit HbA1c) with “implicit HbA1c” which is reversely derived from pretested PPG and finger-pricked blood glucose levels. The implicit HbA1c is then evaluated across intervals up to 90 days since the pretest, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy, while the remaining 13% falls near the CEG zone A boundary. The implicit HbA1c approach exhibits a remarkable 16% improvement over the explicit HbA1c method by covering personal correction items automatically. This improvement not only refines the accuracy of the model but also enhances the practicality of the previously proposed model that relied on an HbA1c input.

Methods: The toe PPG signals of 149 subjects were collected, and 12 characteristic features were extracted according to contour analysis, followed by TcPO2 measurements. TcPO2 measurements were performed on the dorsum of the foot by PeriFlux 6000 TcPO2 system. In addition to PPG features, physiological parameters were also taken into account. A variety of machine learning regression approaches, including extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and Ridge regression (Ridge), were used to predict TcPO2 levels. To evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, different performance indicators such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient were employed. Correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plot analysis were performed to visualize the data. Results: XGBoost outperformed the other three regression models in predicting TcPO2 (R = 0.835, MAE = 5.23 mmHg, RMSE = 6.87 mmHg, MAPE = 9.99%). Reflection index, diabetes, duration of diabetes, heart rate, crest time, the time between the systolic and diastolic peaks (ΔT) were the top six contributions to TcPO2 prediction in the XGBoost model. The PPG characteristic features play a dominant role in TcPO2 estimation. Diabetes and duration of diabetes were also significant factors in TcPO2 prediction. Conclusions: We compared four machine learning methods for TcPO2 prediction. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance of all the algorithms investigated and could be used to forecast TcPO2 values.

Scopus,95,Quantitative analysis of human blood glucose by dynamic optical rotation angle of multiple wavelengths based on the polarization camera,"Measurement of blood glucose concentration is important in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. To improve the measurement signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy, using a polarization camera as the sensor, this paper proposes a multi-wavelength dynamic optical rotation angle method to quantitatively analyze human blood glucose. First, this paper utilizes a split-time approach to drive nine different wavelengths of light sources to work separately to achieve the collection of multiple different wavelengths of data and increase the amount of information. Second, to capture images with an array sensor such as a camera, using space-for-accuracy, this paper uses the cumulative value of the gray values of all pixel points in the image at each angle as the light intensity value to improve the amplitude (light intensity) resolution. Third, the extraction method of the dynamic optical rotation angle in this paper is to extract the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the optical rotation angle from each cycle of the signal of the continuous cyclic change of the length of the optical path, and the accumulated value of the difference of multiple cycles is recorded as the dynamic optical rotation angle, which not only reduces the errors caused by the individual differences, the external environment and the measuring instrument, but also has the effect of averaging and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical rotation angle. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, human finger real and simulation experiments are carried out, respectively. Firstly, the polarization camera is used to collect the image data of elliptically polarized light of nine different wavelengths of linearly polarized light after passing through the human body's finger, and obtains the optical rotation angle under each wavelength that changes with the photoplethysmography (PPG) through data processing, and extracts the dynamic optical rotation angles of the nine wavelengths by the extraction method, and the human body's blood glucose can be quantitatively analyzed. Secondly, this paper builds a simulation model to simulate the blood volume conversion of the human finger, and uses the simulation experimental system to collect the dynamic optical rotation angles of nine wavelengths of a total of 137 human serum samples, and uses partial least squares regression to establish a model between the dynamic optical rotation angles and blood glucose concentration. In the results of predicting all samples using the model, the correlation coefficient and root mean square error were 0.7960 and 2.16 mmol/L, respectively, both of which improved by 137.26 % and decreased by 35.33 %, respectively, compared to the existing method. The experimental results show that the method in this paper has high accuracy in detecting the blood glucose concentration in human beings, which is of great significance in realizing the noninvasive quantitative analysis of human blood glucose components by the polarized light method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.measurement.2024.116008,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,96,"Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring Using PPG, AI, and IoT-Driven Mobile Integration for Real-Time Diabetes Management","Diabetes mellitus patients must regularly monitor their blood glucose levels to manage glycaemia, typically requiring capillary tests at least three times daily and laboratory tests one to two times per month. These conventional methods involve finger pricking, causing significant discomfort and stress.

This study obtained PPG signals from a commercial PPG module, followed by Signal Quality Index (SQI) detection to assess the signal quality and further signal processing, such as filtering and baseline shift. As a result, a total of 36 features were extracted from PPG signals in both time and frequency domains, and a correlation matrix was used to inspect the correlation among features. Machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to train and predict blood glucose levels. Of the 36 features, 9 were selected for use as input data for red and infrared light signals. Four datasets, namely “Red”, “Infrared”, “Composite” (a combination of “Red” and “Infrared”), and “Modified Composite” (a refined version of the “Composite” dataset that reduces feature collinearity and enhances prediction accuracy), were investigated.

Blood pressure, a critical indicator of hypertension, is typically measured intermittently, which limits continuous monitoring. This study explores the development of a prototype for continuous blood pressure monitoring using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. By analyzing vascular contraction signals, we modeled blood pressure through three key PPG features: heart rate, average normal-to-normal intervals, and mean envelope size. Data from 35 participants were collected at rest and post-exercise. Using a two-variable linear regression equation, we found that the combination of heart rate and mean envelope size provided the most accurate systolic blood pressure estimates, with a mean error of 8.58% ± 5.81.

Methods: A total of 1879 patients with diabetes were followed on average of 3.5 years. The radial pulse and PPG signals were measured at the beginning of the trial. Kaplan-Meier curves of the DR risk indicator was analyzed. In addition, the correlation between the measurements of the radial pulse and PPG was evaluated. Results: In comparison of the patients' clinical characteristics, years of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, ACR, urinary albumin and fourth harmonic (C4) were higher in the DR group, and eGFR and third harmonic (C3) were lower. Patients in the high-DR risk group had a 1.8-fold higher risk of developing retinopathy than those in the low-risk group (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

Technological advances currently have an important role in the process of maintaining human health. One of the utilization of technology is a system for checking blood glucose levels. Currently, the blood glucose checking system uses invasive methods, namely, using blood samples. Through the utilization of technological advances, especially control systems, checking blood glucose levels began to be developed non-invasively using photodiode sensors with the Photoplethysmograph (PPG) method.

Some hemodynamically based non-invasive video processing applications have been applied for blood pressure classification and blood glucose prediction objectives for unobtrusive physiological monitoring at home. However, this approach is still under development with very few publications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework, entitled cocktail causal container, to fuse multiple physiological representations and to reconstruct the correlation between frequency and temporal information during multi-task learning. Cocktail causal container processes hematologic reflex information to classify blood pressure and blood glucose. Since the learning of discriminative features from video physiological representations is quite challenging, we propose a token feature fusion block to fuse the multi-view fine-grained representations to a union discrete frequency space. A causal net is used to analyze the fused higher-order information, so that the framework can be enforced to disentangle the latent factors into the related endogenous association that corresponds to down-stream fusion information to improve the semantic interpretation.

Blood glucose level (BGL) is usually monitored by collecting a blood sample and assessing the results. This type of measurement is extremely unpleasant and inconvenient for the patient, who must undergo it frequently. This paper proposes a novel real-time, non-invasive technique for estimating BGL with smartphone photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal extracted from fingertip video and deep neural networks (DNN). Fingertip videos are collected from 93 subjects using a smartphone camera and a lighting source, and subsequently the frames are converted into PPG signal. The PPG signals have been preprocessed with Butterworth bandpass filter to eliminate high frequency noise, and motion artifact. Therefore, there are 34 features that are derived from the PPG signal and its derivatives and Fourier transformed form. In addition, age and gender are also included as features due to their considerable influence on glucose. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) feature selection technique has been applied for selecting the best feature set for obtaining good accuracy. Finally, the DNN model has been established to determine BGL non-invasively. DNN model along with the MIC feature selection technique outperformed in estimating BGL with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96, implying a good relationship between glucose level and selected features. The results of the experiments suggest that the proposed method can be used clinically to determine BGL without drawing blood.  © 2022 IEEE.",10.1109/ICCIT57492.2022.10055090,YES,Unique DOI

We aimed to investigate changes in the pleth variability index (PVI), vena cava collapsibility index (VCCI), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in spontaneously breathing volunteers after acute loss of 450 mL blood and passive leg raise (PLR). Methods This prospective observational study enrolled healthy volunteers in the blood donation center of an academic hospital. We measured the PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP before blood donation; at the 0th and 10th minute of blood donation; and after PLR. The primary outcome was the changes in PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP. Results We enrolled thirty volunteers. There were significant differences among the four obtained measurements of the PVI, EtCO2, and MAP (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Compared to the predonation values, post-hoc analysis revealed an increase in the PVI at the 0th min postdonation (mean difference [MD], 5.4±5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.6 to -3.1; P<0.001); a decrease in the EtCO2 and MAP at the 0th and 10th minute postdonation, respectively (MD, 2.4±4.6; 95% CI, 0.019 to 4.84; P=0.008 and MD, 6.4±6.4; 95% CI, 3 to 9.7; P<0.001, respectively). Compared with EtCO2 at the 10th minute, the value increased after PLR (MD, 1.8±3.2; 95% CI, 0.074 to 4.44; P=0.006).

Therefore, in this method, we realize blood glucose detection by receiving the near-infrared light reflected back after blood glucose absorption. We extracted 26 pulse wave features from the pulse wave and analyzed 6 that were highly correlated with blood glucose. Then, four kinds of machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLS, SVR, RFR) were used to build models respectively, and the RFR with the best performance was selected to build the final blood glucose prediction model.

Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension are at a greater risk for developing the same sequela. Autonomic cardiac control is important in the level of cardiac function. One intervention that is effective in improving cardiovascular function is heart rate variability biofeedback training.

To overcome these long-standing problems, we largely enhanced the training efficiency with the limited personal data by an innovative Deduction Learning (DL), instead of the conventional Induction Learning (IL). The domain theory of our deductive method, DL, made use of accumulated comparison of paired inputs leading to corrections to preceded measured blood glucose to construct our deep neural network architecture. DL method involves the use of paired adjacent rounds of finger pulsation Photoplethysmography signal recordings as the input to a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) based deep learning model. Our study reveals that CNN filters of DL model generated extra and non-uniform feature patterns than that of IL models, which suggests DL is superior to IL in terms of learning efficiency under limited training data. Among 30 diabetic patients as our recruited volunteers, DL model achieved 80% of test prediction in zone A of Clarke Error Grid (CEG) for model training with 12 rounds of data, which was 20% improvement over IL method.

Early diagnosis of CAD requires a combination of multiple tests including a 12-lead ECG test, blood test, and stress test before the patient can go through a more complex procedure such as coronary computed tomography angiography or invasive coronary angiography procedure. The study aims to investigate the association between common parameters from the preliminary test of CAD to the severity of stenosis in the coronary arteries among newly diagnosed IHD patients. A total of 80 CAD patients (55 ± 9.52 years) have participated in this study and their demographic data, vital signs, blood tests, as well as ECG result are taken just before they are going for the angiography procedure. It was found that 75% of the subjects are overweight. The results also showed that the number of patients who smoke, have diabetes, and have hypertension is higher in the case group (stenosis ≥ 70%) as compared to the control group (stenosis < 70%). There was no clinical data that can differentiate severe stenosis in the coronary arteries, except for fasting blood sugar (p=0.002). Subjects with severely blocked arteries tend to have higher levels of blood sugar with a mean of 8.05 ± 3.60. Framingham risk scores (FRS) for both groups were also compared, and it is found that 59% of the total subjects have low FRS, even though half of them have severe stenosis.

Scopus,117,Quantitative analysis of different multi-wavelength ppg devices and methods for noninvasive in-vivo estimation of glycated hemoglobin,"Diabetes is a serious disease affecting the insulin cycle in the human body. Thus, monitoring blood glucose levels and the diagnosis of diabetes in the early stages is very important. Nonin-vasive in vivo diabetes-diagnosis procedures are very new and require thorough studies to be error-resistant and user-friendly. In this study, we compare two noninvasive procedures (two-wave-length-and three-wavelength-based methods) to estimate glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in different scenarios and evaluate them with error level calculations. The three-wavelength method, which has more model parameters, results in a more accurate estimation of HbA1c even when the blood oxygenation (SpO2) values change. The HbA1c-estimation error range of the two-wavelength model, due to change in SpO2, is found to be from −1.306% to 0.047%. On the other hand, the HbA1c estimation error for the three-wavelength model is found to be in the magnitude of 10−14% and in-dependent of SpO2. The approximation of SpO2 from the two-wavelength model produces a lower error for the molar concentration based technique (−4% to −1.9% at 70% to 100% of reference SpO2) as compared to the molar absorption coefficient based technique. Additionally, the two-wavelength model is less susceptible to sensor noise levels (max SD of %error, 0.142%), as compared to the three-wavelength model (max SD of %error, 0.317%). Despite having a higher susceptibility to sensor noise, the three-wavelength model can estimate HbA1c values more accurately; this is because it takes the major components of blood into account and thus becomes a more realistic model. © 2021 by the authors.

While the use of genomic and proteomic personal features for widespread precision hypertension management is not practical, other features, such as age, ethnicity, and cardiovascular diseases, have been utilized in guidelines for hypertension management. In precision medicine, more blood-pressure-related clinical and physiological characteristics in the patient’s profile can be utilized for the determination of the threshold of hypertension and optimal treatment. Several non-invasive and simple-to-use techniques for the measurement of hypertension-related physiological features are suggested for use in precision management of hypertension. In order to provide precise management of hypertension, accurate measurement of blood pressure is required, but the available non-invasive blood pressure measurement techniques, auscultatory sphygmomanometry and oscillometry, have inherent significant inaccuracy—either functional or technological—limiting the precision of personalized management of hypertension. A novel photoplethysmography-based technique for the measurement of systolic blood pressure that was recently found to be more accurate than the two available techniques can be utilized for more precise and personalized hypertension management. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/jpm12111861,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,119,Noninvasive Heart Rate and Blood Glucose Level Estimation Using Photoplethysmography,"Heart rate (HR) and blood glucose level (BGL) are two important indicators of fitness of human health and it is imperative to measure these parameters regularly to avoid severe damages. At present, we need at least two devices such as electrocardiography (ECG) device and invasive BGL measuring devices to measure heart rate and blood glucose level accurately which are costly. In this paper, an easy method has been described to measure both HR and BGL values simultaneously without pricking a finger and without a trained person using a single device only based on photoplethysmography (PPG). In this research work, a pulse sensor is used for PPG signal collection. Then this PPG signal is passed through a bandpass filter for noise removal and amplification to the microcontroller unit (MCU). Then the data obtained from MCU are analyzed using MATLAB for finding HR and BGL values. The peak finding technique is used for finding HR value. For determining BGL values, the dominant feature of the PPG signal is extracted which has the highest correlation with BGL, and then using regression analysis a relationship is established from which we can measure the BGL values without pricking blood. Finally, correlation analysis is also done to analyze the relationship between HR and BGL. As PPG signal acquisition is less costly than ECG and other BGL measuring methods, it will be very helpful for determining HR and BGL values simultaneously at ease. Thus this research work will provide opportunities for early diagnosis of problems related to heart rate and blood glucose level.  © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ICICT4SD50815.2021.9396849,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,120,Multiple regression analysis based non-invasive blood glucose level estimation using photoplethysmography,"This paper presents a non-invasive technique for blood glucose level estimation based on multiple regression analysis that uses the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. Firstly, a digital bandpass filter is designed to remove the noise from the raw signal. Afterward, various parameters of the filtered signal are analyzed and the correlation between the parameters and blood glucose level is determined. Then, using multiple regression, a model has been established to estimate the blood glucose level. Finally, the predicted value obtained using multiple regression analysis was compared to the actual blood glucose value obtained from the invasive technique and to the predicted value obtained using simple linear regression analysis. It was found that percentage deviation lies within 8% in a multiple regression based model that ensures the model's accuracy and for every subject, the percentage deviation in this model is less than the percentage deviation obtained in the single parameter-based model. As this research work uses a PPG signal that is comfortable to use and the accuracy of the multiple parameter based model is higher than the single parameter based model, it will be very effective to estimate blood glucose level easily and accurately.  © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ACMI53878.2021.9528219,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,121,90% accuracy for photoplethysmography‐based non‐invasive blood glucose prediction by deep learning with cohort arrangement and quarterly measured hba1c,"Previously published photoplethysmography‐(PPG) based non‐invasive blood glucose (NIBG) measurements have not yet been validated over 500 subjects. As illustrated in this work, we increased the number subjects recruited to 2538 and found that the prediction accuracy (the ratio in zone A of Clarke’s error grid) reduced to undesirable 60.6%. We suspect the low prediction accuracy induced by larger sample size might arise from the physiological diversity of subjects, and one possibility is that the diversity might originate from medication. Therefore, we split the subjects into two cohorts for deep learning: with and without medication (1682 and 856 recruited subjects, respectively). In comparison, the cohort training for subjects without any medication had approximately 30% higher prediction accuracy over the cohort training for those with medication. Further-more, by adding quarterly (every 3 months) measured glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), we were able to significantly boost the prediction accuracy by approximately 10%. For subjects without medication, the best performing model with quarterly measured HbA1c achieved 94.3% prediction accuracy, RMSE of 12.4 mg/dL, MAE of 8.9 mg/dL, and MAPE of 0.08, which demonstrates a very promising solution for NIBG prediction via deep learning. Regarding subjects with medication, a personalized model could be a viable means of further investigation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.3390/s21237815,YES,Unique DOI

Due to the unavailability of non-invasive glucose level checker until now, the most trustworthy day-to-day life glucose test for personal healthcare is the use of glucometer in which case painful finger pricking is an obvious part. However, researches have been done to prove the usage of pulse oximeter to measure the blood glucose level besides other physiological indicators such as heart rate, percentage of blood oxygen, etc. Here, as the first of two studies, we try to develop an all-purpose commercial prototype photoplethysmography (PPG) system to monitor necessary health indicator parameters in a non-invasive way. The developed fingertip PPG device consists of both transmissive and reflective type data acquisition system after illuminating the skin with red, green, and IR LEDs. Next, as the second study, special consideration is given to prove the efficiency of the device for measuring blood glucose level (BGL). To measure blood glucose from PPG signal, a few discriminative and related features are extracted from the obtained PPG signals. Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict the actual value of BGL from the extracted features. The proposed algorithm and system can predict the BGL level with a level of clinical accuracy.

Scopus,124,Graph Signal Processing Based Classification of Noisy and Clean PPG Signals Using Machine Learning Classifiers for Intelligent Health Monitor,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals play an important role for automatic measurement of pulse rate, blood pressure, non-invasive blood glucose level and respiration rate. Most of the PPG monitoring devices are prone to motion artifacts and noises under different PPG recording conditions. Thus, automatic assessment of PPG signal quality is most essential for discarding unacceptable PPG signals and reducing false alarms due to the noisy measurements.

These methods may be painful and put the patient at risk for infection. These procedures may cause fear in the children. In order to address this issue, we suggest a non-invasive method that combines ISEs, PPG, and infrared (IR) sensors to measure salt, glucose, and hemoglobin levels. By studying the absorption and reflection of infrared light by blood vessels in the subcutaneous tissue, the IR sensor will be used to detect the amount of glucose in the body. PPG operates by measuring the pulsatile blood flow through the arteries, which will reveal information about hemoglobin levels. Lastly, an ISEs sensor will be used to measure sweat pH, which is correlated with sodium concentration, in order to monitor salt levels. Advanced machine learning techniques will be used to interpret the data from these sensors and deliver precise, real-time measures of sodium, hemoglobin, and glucose. To further assess the patient's breathing condition, we have added a breathe analyzer. The IR sensor yields the breathing analyzer output.

Scopus,128,Denoising of photoplethysmograms for non-invasive blood glucose estimation via Slant transform based bit plane method,"It is worth noting that the diabetes is a chronic disease. It causes an irreversible damage to the human organs and even leads to the death. Moreover, for the mortality due to the COVID19, it was found that the death rate of the subjects with the diabetes is higher than that without the diabetes. Therefore, monitoring the blood glucose values is very important. Since the non-invasive blood glucose estimation does not introduce the pain to the subjects and it can reduce the risk of the infection, the non-invasive blood glucose estimation techniques were recently developed. However, it is based on the photoplethysmograms (PPGs). Nevertheless, the PPGs are contaminated by the noise. Hence, performing the denoising is critical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Slant transform based bit plane denoising method to improve the quality of the PPGs. First, the Slant transform is applied to the PPGs. Second, each Slant transform coefficient is represented using a finite number of bits. Third, some bits of the Slant transform coefficients are discarded. Fourth, the inverse Slant transform is applied to the processed PPGs. To perform the blood glucose estimation, the heart rates are extracted from the denoised PPGs and the heart rate variabilities are calculated. They are taken as the features. Then, the feature vectors and the corresponding invasive blood glucose values are used to train a random forest regression model. For the test PPGs, the non-invasive blood glucose values are estimated based on the established model. Compared to the states of the art methods, it is found that our proposed method can effectively improve the ability of estimation. In particular, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and the percentage of the data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid yielded by our proposed method reaches 15.34%, and 75.86%, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/ICIT58465.2023.10143100,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,130,Non-Invasive Classification of Blood Glucose Level for Early Detection Diabetes Based on Photoplethysmography Signal,"Monitoring systems for the early detection of diabetes are essential to avoid potential expensive medical costs. Currently, only invasive monitoring methods are commercially available. These methods have significant disadvantages as patients experience discomfort while obtaining blood samples. A non-invasive method of blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring that is painless and low-cost would address the limitations of invasive techniques. Photoplethysmography (PPG) collects a signal from a finger sensor using a photodiode, and a nearby infrared LED light. The combination of the PPG electronic circuit with artificial intelligence makes it possible to implement the classification of BGL. However, one major constraint of deep learning is the long training phase.

This paper proposes a blood glucose (BG) prediction model for more precise prediction based on BG series decomposition by complete aggregation empirical mode decomposition based on adaptive white noise (CEEMDAN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) that is optimized by improved bacterial foraging optimization (IBFO). Hierarchical clustering technology recombines the decomposed BG series according to their sample entropy and the correlations with the original BG trends. Dynamic BG trends are regressed separately for each recombined BG series by the GRU model to realize the more precise estimations, which are optimized by IBFO for its structure and superparameters. Through experiments, the optimized and basic LSTM, RNN, and support vector regression (SVR) are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the 15-min IBFO-GRU prediction is improved on average by about 13.1% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with those of the RNN and LSTM optimized by IBFO. Meanwhile, the proposed model improved the Clarke error grid results by about 2.6% and 5.0% compared with those of the IBFO-LSTM and IBFO-RNN in 30-min prediction and by 4.1% and 6.6% in 15-min ahead forecast, respectively.

In the presence of noncompressible arteries, the ankle brachial index (ABI) can either be inconclusive or provide false-positive results. Toe pressure measurement has been suggested as an alternative as a noninvasive method for detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Toe pressure measurement can be performed either by photoplethysmography (PPG) or by Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The aim of this study was to determine correlations between the two techniques in order to promote the use of PPG in clinical practice. Methods: This was a prospective correlational study of 108 consecutive recruited adult patients, with and without diabetes, with at least one lower limb wound from a University-affiliated hospital wound care clinic. Toe pressure measurements were both performed with PPG and LDF devices. Results: Mean toe pressure values for PPG and LDF were, respectively, 83.7 (SD 35.4) and 79.5 (SD 32.0) mmHg (with a paired t-test 3.969, P < 0.01). In patients with at least one lower limb wound, a strong linear relation was found between PPG and LDF toe pressure techniques with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of 0.920 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: PPG and LDF toe pressure techniques are equivalent in patients with at least one lower limb wound, irrespective of the presence of diabetes. Therefore, in the presence of an ABI with inconclusive results, such as in a patient with noncompressible vessels, both toe pressure techniques can be used for assessing the vascular supply of the lower limb with a wound. © 2020 Diabetes Technology Society.",10.1177/1932296820979973,YES,Unique DOI

The most common way is through an invasive blood test that causes pain, fear, discomfort and an important economic impact. Recent studies have shown a correlation between heart rate variability (HRV) and glucose levels, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. This research aimed at designing a machine learning algorithm for glucose level detection using HRV features. Methods: We acquired physiological and clinical data from 5, yielding 100 observations. Then, we detected peaks from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and evaluated the peak detection accuracy. Afterwards, we measured multiple HRV-related features from such peaks. Then, data was curated, and relevant features were selected. After that, hyperparameters were optimized for 5 different estimators, and such values were used to create and evaluate predictive models. Results: The PPG peak detection algorithm performed efficiently, with an above 99% precision. The feature selection process yielded 20 features, 65% of them were HRV-related. The best model for glucose level detection was an ensemble between a Support Vector Machine, a Lasso and an Elasticnet model, with a mean absolute error of 16.24 mg/dL. Discussion: HRV features were very important to detect glucose levels. But fatigue, blood pressure and BMI were also included in the final model. We were limited by the size of the dataset, but our results are promising and HRV should be further explored as an indirect way of measuring blood glucose concentration. Additionally, and unlike similar studies in which HRV was measured from medical-grade electrocardiogram equipment, we measured HRV features from a PPG signal obtained using a commercial pulse oximeter.

People with diabetes need regular checks of their blood glucose levels to keep track of them and maintain them in healthy ranges. These regular checks are expensive in terms of the consumables being used to perform the tests, i.e., test strips and prick needles, as they are changed every time a test is conducted. Also, the discomfort and pain during the sample collection and the risk of getting an infection are high. This calls for non- invasive methods of blood glucose testing where the test can be done without the need to draw blood. This study uses the Max30102 biosensor, which is a pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor as a non-invasive device to test blood sugar levels by acquiring samples from the patient. The choice of this sensor is informed by studies showing that even during the early stages of diabetes mellitus type 2, there is a change in blood vessels and this in turn affects the pulse rate. The solution showed a positive correlation comparison between the acquired data from volunteers using the non-invasive device and invasive glucometer data from the same volunteers. The results were able to prove the feasibility of the device to test diabetes type 2 without the need to invasively get the samples.

Furthermore, such old methods need the use of heavy equipment, blood draws, and traditional bench-top testing procedures. Invasive ways of acquiring test samples can potentially cause patient discomfort and anguish. Wearable sensors, on the other hand, may be attached to numerous body areas to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics as a developing analytical tool. Physical, chemical, and biological data transferred via the skin are used to monitor health in various circumstances. Wearable sensors can assess the aberrant conditions of the physical or chemical components of the human body in real time, exposing the body state in time, thanks to unintrusive sampling and high accuracy. Most commercially available wearable gadgets are mechanically hard components attached to bands and worn on the wrist, with form factors ultimately constrained by the size and weight of the batteries required for the power supply. Basic physiological signals comprise a lot of health-related data. The estimation of critical physiological characteristics, such as pulse inconstancy or variability using photoplethysmography (PPG) and oxygen saturation in arterial blood using pulse oximetry, is possible by utilizing an analysis of the pulsatile component of the bloodstream. Wearable gadgets with “skin-like” qualities are a new type of automation that is only starting to make its way out of research labs and into pre-commercial prototypes.

Monitoring of Blood glucose levels is one of the important physiological information for medical professionals. Non-invasive detection of blood glucose levels is necessary for monitoring and managing diabetes and reducing the need for frequent finger pricks as invasive methods. Non-invasive measurement of blood glucose provides a convenient and pain-free alternative to traditional invasive methods. The traditional methods require pricking of the finger for taking blood samples and calibration for proper results. Non-calibrated devices can lead to faulty results. In this study, a photo detector-based approach is used to measure the blood glucose level. The system is based on a photodetector sensor that detects the changes in light absorption caused by variations in blood glucose levels. In this study, we performed experiments on two sets of groups, one with normal and the other with fasting state to compare the invasive and non-invasive values of glucose in different subjects to make a standard non-invasive glucometer system. The evaluation was conducted on a group of participants before and after the ingestion of glucose during the procedure. The sensor was placed superficially on the fingertip to acquire the photoplethysmography signal along with the traditional measurement method for reference blood glucose values. The MATLAB-based algorithm has been designed to further filter and process the signal and measure the blood glucose level. The results indicate a strong correlation between photoplethysmography detector-based measurement and the reference blood glucose levels. The non-invasive method exhibited promising accuracy and reliability in estimating blood glucose concentrations.

Scopus,142,"Temporal Attention Splitting Network for Non-invasive Blood Glucose, Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation","In this paper, a new lightweight and efficient time-series backbone structure-temporal attention splitting network (TAS) is built, and good estimation of Cuff-Less blood pressure and non-invasive blood glucose is achieved on this model using photoplethysmography(PPG) signals. Blood pressure and blood glucose are two critical indicators of human health, reflecting people's health well. Convenient and accurate blood pressure and blood glucose measurements are increasingly popular. In this paper, the estimation of non-invasive blood glucose and CuffLess blood pressure are achieved by collecting the PPG signals of 20 volunteers and the PPG signals of 200 patients obtained from the MIMIC-II database, respectively. The experimental results show: on the blood glucose dataset, the TAS model proposed in this paper achieved a standard error of prediction SEP =10.90mg/dL, Pearson correlation coefficient R=0.93, and determination coefficient R2=0.86, and 93.94% of the prediction points are located in A when the clinical safety of the model effect is evaluated with a Clark error grid region. On the blood pressure dataset, the absolute mean error MAE =1.48 mmHg and standard deviation STD =2.31 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and MAE =2.85 mmHg and STD =4.65 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP). According to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) treatment protocol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure achieved grade A. These results show that TAS is an accurate estimator that can learn PPG well with blood glucose and blood pressure information. © 2022 IEEE.",10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-ScalCom-DigitalTwin-PriComp-Metaverse56740.2022.00188,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,143,Skin Color Information Extraction using a Cylindrical Reflection Sensor for Glycated Hemoglobin Estimation using PPG signals,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is an important measure that should be monitored in daily life for the measurement and management of diabetes. Since the HbAl c reflects the average blood glucose level of about 3 months, it is possible to effectively monitor the blood glucose level of diabetic patients. In addition, a noninvasive HbAl c estimation method using the PPG signal has been the subject of recent research, and this method can enable convenient health management without the pain of blood collection and the risk of infection. Several methods have been proposed to noninvasively estimate HbA1c, but they do not secure sufficient accuracy. In order to overcome this, it is urgent to find a method to improve the accuracy by considering skin color and skin thickness.

Scopus,144,Non-Invasive Classification of Blood Glucose Level Based on Photoplethysmography Using Time–Frequency Analysis,"Diabetes monitoring systems are crucial for avoiding potentially significant medical expenses. At this time, the only commercially viable monitoring methods that exist are invasive ones. Since patients are uncomfortable while blood samples are being taken, these techniques have significant disadvantages. The drawbacks of invasive treatments might be overcome by a painless, inexpensive, non-invasive approach to blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals obtained from sensor leads placed on specific organ tissues are collected using photodiodes and nearby infrared LEDs. Cardiovascular disease can be detected via photoplethysmography. These characteristics can be used to directly affect BGL monitoring in diabetic patients if PPG signals are used. The Guilin People’s Hospital’s open database was used to produce the data collection. The dataset was gathered from 219 adult respondents spanning an age range from 21 to 86 of which 48 percent were male. There were 2100 sampling points total for each PPG data segment. The methodology of feature extraction from data may assist in increasing the effectiveness of classifier training and testing. PPG data information is modified in the frequency domain by the instantaneous frequency (IF) and spectral entropy (SE) moments using the time–frequency (TF) analysis. Three different forms of raw data were used as inputs, and we investigated the original PPG signal, the PPG signal with instantaneous frequency, and the PPG signal with spectral entropy. According to the results of the model testing, the PPG signal with spectral entropy generated the best outcomes. Compared to decision trees, subspace k-nearest neighbor, and k-nearest neighbor, our suggested approach with the super vector machine obtains a greater level of accuracy. The super vector machine, with 91.3% accuracy and a training duration of 9 s, was the best classifier. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/info14030145,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,145,Relationship between PPG Signals and Glucose levels through Chaotic Descriptors and Support Vector Machines,"When shining a light through a finger, some of it will be absorbed by oxygenated and unoxygenated hemoglobin. Measuring the absorbed light over time provides the photo-plethysmographic (PPG) waveform, which can represent the blood flow of a subject. One way of obtaining the PPG waveform is to use the camera and flash of a smartphone, placing them on the finger of a subject, and analyzing the variation of red color. The PPG can also be obtained using oximeter-like devices, which are non-invasive and safe. In contrast, to measure the blood glucose of a subject, a glucometer is used, which is a device that is typically invasive and expensive. Therefore, we propose the use of the following descriptors from Chaos theory to analyze the PPG signal: correlation dimension, maximum Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent. Then, these values are converted into a 3-dimensional vector that can be represented in a 3-dimensional space. Each vector has an associated glucose level that is used to train an algorithm which classifies all the vectors in three different ranges of blood glucose levels.  © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/IAICT52856.2021.9532517,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,146,Machine‐Learning‐Based Noninvasive In Vivo Estimation of HbA1c Using Photoplethysmography Signals,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is an important factor in monitoring diabetes. Since the glycated hemoglobin value reflects the average blood glucose level over 3 months, it is not affected by exercise or food intake immediately prior to measurement. Thus, it is used as the most basic measure of evaluating blood‐glucose control over a certain period and predicting the occurrence of long‐term complications due to diabetes. However, as the existing measurement methods are invasive, there is a burden on the measurement subject who has to endure increased blood gathering and exposure to the risk of secondary infections. To overcome this problem, we propose a machine-learning‐based noninvasive estimation method in this study using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. First, the development of the device used to acquire the PPG signals is described in detail. Thereafter, discriminative and effective features are extracted from the acquired PPG signals using the device, and a machine‐learning algorithm is used to estimate the glycated hemoglobin value from the extracted features.

The conventional finger‐prick method, though accurate, is not feasible for use multiple times a day, as it is painful and test strips are expensive. Although minimally invasive and noninvasive CGM systems have been introduced into the market, they are expensive and require finger‐prick calibrations. As the diabetes trend is high in low‐ and middle‐income countries, a cost‐effective and easy‐to‐use noninvasive glucose monitoring device is the need of the hour. This review paper briefly discusses the noninvasive glucose measuring technologies and their related research work. The technologies discussed are optical, transdermal, and enzymatic. The paper focuses on Near Infrared (NIR) technology and NIR Photoplethysmography (PPG) for blood glucose prediction.

Scopus,148,Accurate measurement of SpO2 and dermal skin hydration using a wearable miniaturized spectrometer,"We present the performance of a CMOS miniaturized (4mm x 3.2mm x 3.3mm) spectrometer for two specific wearable health applications: reflective medically-accurate SpO2 and dermal H2O measurement for preventive health and remote follow-up use cases. The spectrometer has been manufactured using a monolithically integrated filter process, enabling low-cost, low-power, miniature and mass-producible spectral sensors. Accurate biomarker models can be built using continuous on-skin hyperspectral tissue and PPG data. A deoxygenation trial on 17 healthy volunteers was conducted using the wrist-worn spectrometer in the 650-900nm wavelength range. Using partial least squares (PLS) modeling, a model was built to correlate the obtained spectral PPG data to SpO2 data from a reference finger clip (Nonin 8000A). In the tested range between 87% and 100% SpO2, an RMSEP of 1.86%SpO2 has been obtained on a separate test set, well within the 3.5% requirement of the FDA. For dermal skin hydration, a study on 29 volunteers (including 4 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and fluid retention in legs) was conducted with the spectrometer in the 750-1050 nm range. A spectroscopic model was compared with a lymph scanner as gold standard measuring localized percentage water content (PWC), yielding a decent prediction accuracy of 3.3% RMSE, while correctly identifying the patients with CHF. We demonstrated the viability of a miniaturized spectrometer for wearable skin biomarker measurements.

Noninvasive in vivo blood‐glucose measurements help reduce the pain of piercing human fingertips to collect blood. To facilitate noninvasive meas-urements, this work proposes a Monte Carlo photon simulation‐based model to estimate blood-glucose concentration via photoplethysmography (PPG) on the fingertip. A heterogeneous finger model was exposed to light at 660 nm and 940 nm in the reflectance mode of PPG via Monte Carlo photon propagation. The bio‐optical properties of the finger model were also deduced to design the photon simulation model for the finger layers. The intensities of the detected photons after simulation with the model were used to estimate the blood‐glucose concentrations using a supervised ma-chine‐learning model, XGBoost. The XGBoost model was trained with synthetic data obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations and tested with both synthetic and real data (n = 35). For testing with synthetic data, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) of the model was found to be 0.91, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was found to be 0.83. On the other hand, for tests with real data, the Pearson’s r of the model was 0.85, and R2 was 0.68. Error grid analysis and Bland–Altman analysis were also performed to confirm the accuracy.

The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful, and uncomfortable for the patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine level based on PPG signal using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1 st and 2 nd) and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included to feature because of the significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and over-fitting. Finally, DNN based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R2 = 0:922 for Hb, R2 = 0:902 for Gl, and R2 = 0:969 for Cr. Experimental aftermaths show that the proposed method is a suitable technique to be used clinically to measure human blood component levels without taking blood samples.

Scopus,155,IoT Based Health Monitor for Remote Patient,"There are lot of people who die from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as the heart attack. The CVDs are most likely caused by a delay in ignorance of early heart attack symptoms which are barely noticeable and patients receiving treatment. Those who attend regular checkups in their nearest medical care centers were advised to check their cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) risk factors like diabetes, tobacco smokers, etc. The use of electronic sensors in the healthcare environment in particular during diagnostics plays an important role in helping to detect potential CVDs. Conducting appropriate healthcare screening and monitoring can detect early symptoms that could be easily treatable. For example, a CVD such as heart disease can be attended to by following a healthy diet, physical exercise, taking the right drug medication, and avoiding substance (i.e. smoking tobacco, alcohol, etc). In this paper, an intelligent IoT based system which monitor's heartbeat was developed for remote patients. It exposes non-communicable CVDs symptoms by scanning human body in areas where photoelectric light can penetrate to detect a change in blood flow circulated by the heart. It uses the microcontroller, ESP32, to converts the analog photoelectric readings from a pulse sensor, MAX30102, into digital beats per minute (BPM), oxygen levels and a body temperature reading. The results showed a 90% accuracy with only few people showing a reading mismatch with a difference of 2-3%. Furthermore, it was noted that the system relied on the internet availability for the real-time reading to be transmitted to mobile application and online dashboard.

Scopus,156,Will Smartphone Applications Replace the Insertable Cardiac Monitor in the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation? The First Comparison in a Case Report of a Cryptogenic Stroke Patient,"Background and Case: This case report exemplifies the clinical application of non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG)-based rhythm monitoring in the awakening mobile health (mHealth) era to detect symptomatic and asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in a cryptogenic stroke patient. Despite extensive diagnostic workup, the etiology remains unknown in one out of three ischemic strokes (i.e., cryptogenic stroke). Prolonged cardiac monitoring can reveal asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in up to one-third of this population. This case report describes a cryptogenic stroke patient who received prolonged cardiac monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) as standard of care. In the context of a clinical study, the patient simultaneously monitored his heart rhythm with a PPG-based smartphone application. AF was detected simultaneously on both the ICM and smartphone application after three days of monitoring. Similar AF burden was detected during follow-up (five episodes, median duration of 28 and 34 h on ICM and mHealth, respectively, p = 0.5). The detection prompted the initiation of oral anticoagulation and AF catheter ablation procedure. Conclusion: This is the first report of the cryptogenic stroke patient in whom PPG-based mHealth was able to detect occurrence and burden of the symptomatic and asymptomatic paroxysmal AF episodes with similar precision as ICM. It accentuates the potential role of PPG-based mHealth in prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients.

The RMS error comes out to be 2.1525 mg/dL which is superior to existing non-invasive techniques. To prove the correctness, three standard techniques viz. geometric regression, Bland-Altman analyses and surveillance error grid are used.

Currently, blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer—however, this process is uncomfortable for the patient. In this paper, a smartphone video-based noninvasive technique is proposed for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood. The videos are collected steadily from the tip of the subject’s finger using smartphone cameras and subsequently converted into a Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. A Gaussian filter is applied on top of the Asymmetric Least Square (ALS) method to remove high-frequency noise, optical noise, and motion interference from the raw PPG signal. These preprocessed signals are then used for extracting signal features such as systolic and diastolic peaks, the time differences between consecutive peaks (DelT), first derivative, and second derivative peaks.

Commonly, the BGL is usually measured invasively by taking blood samples, which can cause pain or discomfort to the patients. Our paper aims to design and develop a low-cost, low-computational non-invasive blood glucose measuring system using optical technique. The proposed system consists of a hardware for measuring photoplethysmogram (PPG). The PPG signal is subsequently analyzed to estimate the corresponding BGL, which is sent wirelessly to be stored in a database and displayed on an Android application. The application recommends the appropriate dosage of insulin injection based on the type of users and their diets. The report of historical blood glucose levels in the database can also be generated for further medical examination.Three PPG features, namely peak-to-peak amplitude, maximum amplitude, and standard deviation of signal amplitude, have the strongest correlations to the BGL. We investigate three regression models for estimating the BGL from these PPG parameters. The robustness of the system is assessed using cross validations. The average root mean squares error (RMSE) for three-fold cross-validations are 17.38, 16.76, and 16.39 mg/dL for simple linear regression, principal component regression, and partial least squares regression, respectively. The RMSEs from leave-one-out cross validation are approximately 12 mg/dL, with partial least squares regression model having the best accuracy. Furthermore, the results from Clarke Error Grid Analysis indicate that the system can be implemented with any of the three models for practical usage.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/BMEiCON60347.2023.10321988,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,169,Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring Using NIR Spectroscopy,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a metabolic condition, can lead to major health problems if it is not adequately treated. Traditional blood glucose monitors are intrusive and give people pain and irritation. As a result, the study's goal was to find a non-invasive way to measure blood glucose. To determine blood glucose parameters, this system uses an NIR Spectroscopy-based system with a light source of wavelength 950nm. The light source illuminates the skin of the wrist, and a photodiode receiver captures the reflected beam. An Arduino UNO microcontroller receives the conditioned signal and digitalizes it. The spectrum is calculated by the Arduino board based on the subject's blood glucose levels.

Scopus,170,Determination of New Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Detection Method Based on Spectral Decomposition; [基于谱分解的无创血糖检测新方法研究],"Diabetes is a disease of abnormal glucose metabolism that manifests as hyperglycemia. If the glucose level in the blood remains very low or very high for long periods, it could cause serious diseases including tissue damage, stroke, heart disease, blindness and kidney failure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), currently there are around 450 million cases of diabetes in the world. With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for glucose measuring equipment has become increasingly urgent. As the currently popular invasive blood glucose measuring equipment will cause inconvenience and pain to patients and may even cause infections, it will inevitably bring psychological and physiological pressure to patients in the long term. Therefore, the realization of non-invasive blood glucose measurement has important clinical application value. Photoplethysmography(PPG) pulse wave contains abundant information about human cardiovascular physiology and pathology. This paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on spectral decomposition, aiming at the spectral information related to blood glucose concentration changes in the PPG signal that is difficult to observe in the time domain Continuous Wavelet Transform(CWT) is used to decompose the PPG signal from the corresponding scale and details in order to obtain the spectral component amplitude information related to the change of blood glucose concentration. Studies have found that there is a higher correlation between the change inthe amplitude of the PPG signal spectral components and the changes in the blood glucose concentration. Through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), the detected blood glucose concentration and the obtained relevant PPG signal spectral components amplitude is modeled by partial least square regression, and the established model is evaluated. The Root Mean Square of Calibration (RMSEC) of the calibration set is 12.47 mg•dL-1, which is 0.69 mmol•L-1, and the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of the prediction set is 6.21 mg•dL-1, which is 0.35 mmol•L-1. The agreement between the predicted value of model's blood glucose concentration and the reference value is 96.00%. The results of the OGTT experiments show that the spectral decomposition method can effectively separate the vibration characteristic absorption spectra of blood glucose molecular groups, and the blood glucose spectral component modeling can minimize the impact of physiological variability and various environmental conditions. The prediction results of the model meet the national testing standards (>95%). Clark grid error analysis show that the results predicted by this method can be used for daily blood glucose monitoring of patients. © 2021, Peking University Press.

Scopus,171,"Continuous maternal hemodynamics monitoring at delivery using a novel, noninvasive, wireless,ppg-based sensor","Objective: To evaluate continuous monitoring of maternal hemodynamics during labor and delivery utilizing an innovative, noninvasive, reflective photoplethysmography-based device. Study design: The Biobeat Monitoring Platform includes a wearable wristwatch monitor that auto-matically samples cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), heart rate (HR) every 5 s and uploads all data to a smartphone-based app and to a data cloud, enabling remote patient monitoring and analysis of data. Low-risk parturients at term, carrying singletons pregnancies, were recruited at early delivery prior to the active phase. Big data analysis of the collected data was performed using the Power BI analysis tool (Microsoft). Next, data were normalized to visual presentation using Excel Data Analysis and the regression tool. Average measurements were compared before and after rupture of membranes, epidural anesthesia, fetal delivery, and placental expulsion. Results: Eighty-one parturients entered analysis. Epidural anesthesia was associated with a slight elevation in CO (5.5 vs. 5.6, L/min, 10 min before and after EA, p <0.05) attributed to a non-significant increase in both HR and SV. BP remained stable as of counter decrease in SVR (1361 vs. 1319 mmHg⋅min⋅mL−1, 10 min before and after EA, p <0.05). Fetal delivery was associated with a peak in CO after which it rapidly declined (6.0 vs. 7.2 vs. 6.1 L/min, 30 min before vs. point of delivery vs. after delivery, p <0.05). The mean BP remained stable throughout delivery with a slight increase at fetal delivery (92 vs. 95 vs. 92.1 mmHg, p <0.05), reflecting the increase in CO and decrease in SVR (1284 vs. 1112 vs. 1280 mmHg⋅min⋅mL−1,p <0.05)with delivery. Placental expulsion was associated with a second peak in CO and decrease in SVR. Conclusions: We presented a novel application of noninvasive hemodynamic maternal monitoring throughout labor and delivery for both research and clinical use. © 2020 by the authors.

Scopus,172,Multi-models with averaging in feature domain for non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"Diabetes is a serious chronic metabolic disease. In the recent years, more and more studies focus on the use of the non-invasive methods to achieve the blood glucose estimation. More and more consumer technology enterprises focusing on human health are committed to implementing accurate and noninvasive blood glucose algorithm in their products. The near infrared spectroscopy built in the wearable devices is one of the common approaches to achieve the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. However, due to the interference from the external environment, these wearable non-invasive methods yield the low estimation accuracy. Even if it is not medical equipment, as a consumer product, the detection accuracy will also be an important indicator for consumers. To address this issue, this paper employs different models based on different ranges of the blood glucose values for performing the blood glucose estimation. First the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are acquired and they are denoised via the bit plane singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Second, the features are extracted. For the data in the training set, first the features are averaged across the measurements in the feature domain via the optimization approach. Second, the random forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the training set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood glucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose values in the same group are employed to build an individual model. Fifth, for each feature, the average of the feature values for all the measurements in the same subset is computed. For the data in the test set, first, the sum of the weighted distances between the test feature values and the average values obtained in the above is computed for each model. Here, the weights are defined based on the importance sorted by the random forest obtained in the above. The model corresponding to the smallest sum is assigned. Finally, the blood glucose value is estimated based on the corresponding model. Compared to the state of arts methods, our proposed method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy. In particular, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and the percentage of the data fall in the zone A of the Clarke error grid yielded by our proposed method reaches 12.19%, and 87.0588%, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.",10.1109/ISPCE-ASIA57917.2022.9971019,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,173,The Effectiveness of Wearable Devices Using Artificial Intelligence for Blood Glucose Level Forecasting or Prediction: Systematic Review,"Background: In 2021 alone, diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder primarily characterized by abnormally high blood glucose (BG) levels, affected 537 million people globally, and over 6 million deaths were reported. The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions: This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future. © Arfan Ahmed, Sarah Aziz, Alaa Abd-alrazaq, Faisal Farooq, Mowafa Househ, Javaid Sheikh.

Scopus,175,Photoplethysmography Analysis with Duffing–Holmes Self-Synchronization Dynamic Errors and 1D CNN-Based Classifier for Upper Extremity Vascular Disease Screening,"Common upper limb peripheral artery diseases (PADs) are atherosclerosis, embolic dis-eases, and systemic diseases, which are often asymptomatic, and the narrowed arteries (stenosis) will gradually reduce blood flow in the right or left upper limbs. Upper extremity vascular disease (UEVD) and atherosclerosis are high-risk PADs for patients with Type 2 diabetes or with both diabetes and end-stage renal disease. For early UEVD detection, a fingertip-based, toe-based, or wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) tool is a simple and noninvasive measurement system for vital sign monitoring and healthcare applications. Based on time-domain PPG analysis, a Duffing–Holmes system with a master system and a slave system is used to extract self-synchronization dynamic errors, which can track the differences in PPG morphology (in amplitudes (systolic peak) and time delay (systolic peak to diastolic peak)) between healthy subjects and PAD patients. In the preliminary analysis, the self-synchronization dynamic errors can be used to evaluate risk levels based on the reflection index (RI), which includes normal condition, lower PAD, and higher PAD. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is established as a multilayer classifier for automatic UEVD screening. The experimental results indicated that the self-synchronization dynamic errors have a positive correlation with the RI (R2 = 0.6694). The K-fold cross-validation is used to verify the performance of the proposed classifier with recall (%), precision (%), accuracy (%), and F1 score. © 2021 by the authors.

Scopus,176,Non-Invasive Blood Sugar Measurement System,"Diabetes results from insufficient insulin production, increasing the risk of various health issues when not well-controlled. Managing it can be invasive and uncomfortable, often requiring blood samples or subdermal device implantation. The search of people with diabetes for a device that is easy to use, painless, requires less expense, and provides continuous monitoring has led researchers to find a way to measure glucose in a non-invasive way, which is why the project focuses on the development of a non-invasive glucometer using different infrared wavelengths. The system consists of implementing an optical sensor to detect photoplethysmography signals with a wavelength of 830nm, which is processed by an ESP32 microcontroller, determining the glucose absorbance to subsequently predict the glucose value in the patient's blood through equations set forth for different absorbance ranges. In addition, the results are shown on the system screen after 60 seconds of entering the finger. The tests were developed in 29 volunteers, and a blood sample was extracted for a laboratory test to determine glucose. Later, the system was analyzed under the ISO 15197 standard that allows quantifying the measurement precision of the glucose level using the Clarke error grid locating all the glucose values obtained in section A, which makes the system clinically acceptable.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/ETCM58927.2023.10309049,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,177,The Use of Photoplethysmography for Blood Glucose Estimation by Noninvasive Method,"Noninvasive blood glucose estimation system based on photoplethysmography is proposed in this paper. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique which uses infrared light to determine the fluctuations in blood stream in the human body with every pulse. However literature reveals that, a functional correlation exists among pulse signal waveform and the glucose contents in the blood. Many researchers have shown estimation of glucose using different spectroscopy techniques which involves an optical sensor. The key involvement of this paper is withdrawal of different features with respect to time domain as well as frequency domain. Exploration of single pulse is also carried out with different features. A PPG data of 182 random people with varied health conditions like diabetic, blood pressure condition is recorded for about 1 min duration. The glucose estimation is done in two ways: the first one is feature extraction from complete PPG signal of a patient and the second one is single pulse wave analysis. All the features from above-mentioned methods are transformed into feature vector which acts as input to system and estimation of blood glucose is performed. We used Clarke Error Grid Analysis for blood glucose estimation which is clinically accepted. With time and frequency domain features we got 43.75% samples in region A and 50% samples in region B, so total 93.75% samples are in regions A and B. Using single pulse wave analysis we got 59.66% samples in region A and 34.61% samples in region B, so total 94.27% samples are in clinically accepted regions (A and B). As single pulse wave analysis shows significant improvement in region A (20% of actual blood glucose value), this method is good selection for glucose measurement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",10.1007/978-981-19-6913-3_21,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,179,Type 2 Diabetes Detection With Light CNN From Single Raw PPG Wave,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive and cost-efficient optical technique used to assess blood volume variations in the microcirculation. PPG technology is widely used in a variety of wearable sensors to investigate the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of PPG analysis for carrying out large-scale screening to prevent and detect diabetes. However, most of these studies require feature extraction and/or several pre-processing steps. Over the past few years, the advent of deep learning has significantly impacted the analysis of biomedical signals. Despite their success in other fields, however, very few studies have focused on the application of deep learning to raw PPG signals for detecting diabetes. Existing studies have proposed large models trained on large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a Light CNN-based model for screening the presence of type 2 diabetes using a single raw pulse extracted from photoplethysmographic signals. In addition to the baseline architecture, we evaluate different model architectures that take as input age and biological sex or PPG handcrafted features. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to all the tested architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of harnessing pre-trained models in detecting diabetes. We tested a model pre-trained on a general PPG shape dataset and another model pre-trained on a dataset containing hypertension PPG signals. Our model scored an AUC of 75.5 when trained with raw PPG waves, age, and biological sex without applying transfer learning, which is competitive with current state of the art.  © 2023 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3274484,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,180,A 186μW Photoplethysmography-Based Noninvasive Glucose Sensing SoC,"Recent trends in research and the market show high demand for frequent monitoring of glucose to estimate the blood sugar level non-invasively which can replace the conventional finger-prick glucometer for daily use. This paper presents a high precision near-infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) based noninvasive glucose monitoring System on Chip (SoC). The proposed system implements a fully differential Analog Frontend (AFE) with nonlinear medium Gaussian support-vector-regression (NMG-SVR) for glucose estimation. The AFE design incorporates chopping which enables the reduction of the integrated input-referred current noise to 9.4pArms thus achieving a dynamic range of 115dB. The glucose prediction processor (GPP) removes noise from the PPG signal, extracts ten unique features, and estimates the blood glucose level using a trained customized NMG-SVR model that minimizes the hardware cost by 25%. The extracted features are carefully designed and implemented to ensure inter-feature dependency, which helps to reduce the overall area by more than 40%. Moreover, GPP is implemented using power and clock gating techniques to minimize both static and dynamic power consumption.

Scopus,181,Feasibility of home-based tracking of insulin resistance from vascular stiffness estimated from the photoplethysmographic finger pulse waveform,"Objective. In this study we explored the utility of post-prandial vascular stiffness as a surrogate measure for estimating insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic condition. Approach. A cohort of 51 healthy young adults with varying body mass index (BMI) values was studied using fasting plasma values of insulin and glucose, fasting and post-meal finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance 2 (HOMA-IR2) using fasting plasma insulin and glucose. Vascular stiffness was estimated by reciprocal of pulse arrival time (rPAT) from ECG and finger PPG at five time points from fasting to 2 h post-oral glucose ingestion. We examined if insulin resistance correlates with meal-induced vascular stiffness changes, supporting the feasibility of using finger PPG to estimate insulin resistance. Main results. HOMA-IR2 was positively correlated with an early rise (0 to 30 min post-meal) and delayed fall (30 to 120 min post-meal) of rPAT. Correlation persisted even after the effect of BMI has been partialled out in subgroup analysis. We conclude that finger PPG-based pulse waveform and single-lead ECG has the potential to be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of insulin resistance. Significance. As both signals, namely ECG and PPG, can be easily acquired using wearable and other low-cost sensing systems, the present study can serve as a pointer to develop accessible strategies for monitoring and longitudinal tracking of insulin resistance in health and pathophysiological states.  © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",10.1088/1361-6579/ac6d3f,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,184,Photoplethysmography-Based Blood Pressure Monitoring Could Improve Patient Outcome during Anesthesia Induction,"During anesthesia, noncritical patients are routinely monitored via noninvasive cuff-based blood pressure (BP) monitors. Due to the noncontinuous nature of the monitoring, the BP values of the patient remain unavailable between consecutive cuff measurements, carrying the risk of missing rapid and sudden variations in BP. We evaluated the added value of using a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based continuous BP measurement device in addition to the standard cuff-based monitoring in a cohort of 40 patients in comparison with the current approach, in which only intermittent cuff-based measurements are available. When using a three-minute cuff measurement interval, using the PPG-based BP measurement in addition to the cuff-based monitor reduced the error (mean ± SD) of systolic (SBP) and mean (MBP) BP from 2.6 ± 19.6 mmHg and 1.2 ± 13.2 mmHg to 0.5 ± 11.2 mmHg and 0.0 ± 8.1 mmHg, respectively. Error grid analysis was also used to assess the improvement in patient safety. The additional use of the PPG-based BP measurement reduced the amount of data falling into higher risk categories. For SBP, points falling in the significant-, moderate-, and low-risk categories decreased from 1.1%, 8.7%, and 19.3% to 0.0%, 2.3%, and 9.6%, respectively. Similar results were obtained for MBP. These results suggest that using a PPG-based BP monitor—in addition to the standard cuff-based monitor—can improve patient safety during anesthesia induction, with no additional sensor needed. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/jpm12101571,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,185,Design and construction of a non-invasive blood glucose and heart rate meter by photoplethysmography,"This article describes the design and construction of a non-invasive blood glucose and heart rate meter that can non-invasively measure blood glucose level and heart rate from the fingertip. This device operates on the principle of light absorption, known as the Beer-Lambert Law, tracking changes in near-infrared light absorbance of blood glucose with blood volume changes in a photoplethysmogram (PPG) using opto-electronics. The design incorporates near-infrared 950 nm wavelength and red 630 nm wavelength LED light sources and a photodiode light receiver. An Arduino NANO 3.0 Mini USB microcontroller was used for signal processing, enabling the meter to compute blood glucose levels in the range of 70 to 130 mg/dL and measure heart rate across the range of 60 to 100 bpm. To validate the effectiveness of this device, it was used by a sample group of diabetic patients at the Endocrine Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Vajira Hospital. The results of device evaluation compared with standard clinical measurements were as follows: 1) The non-invasive blood glucose meter accurately measured blood sugar levels in the range of 75 to 150 mg/dL (R2 = 0.99); 2) Across the ranges of 75 to 130 mg/dL and 131 to 289 mg/dL the device had average percentage error of 3.18% and 22.14%, respectively and the overall average percentage error was 10.76%; 3) Heart rate measurements from 60 to 100 bpm showed a mean percentage error of 2.94%, and these were not statistically different from a vital sign monitor (p= 0.222), and 4) Although readings from the meter appeared to be systematically lower than results of standard blood tests, this was not a statistically significant difference (p= 0.135). Overall, these findings indicate that this non-invasive blood glucose meter may be suitable for non-critical patient monitoring applications where patient comfort and convenience are important considerations. © 2022, Rangsit University.

Scopus,186,Overview of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Wearable Devices for Diabetes: Scoping Review,"Background: Prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased over the last few decades with 1.5 million deaths reported in 2012 alone. Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective: This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results: From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions: This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain.

Scopus,188,A Correlational Study on Cardiopulmonary Endurance in Male Patients with New-Onset Type 2 Diabetes,"Background: Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) are widely used non-invasive and reliable functional evaluation methods. This study investigated the correlation between cardiopulmonary endurance indices and plasma glucose levels and abdominal visceral fat in males with new-onset type 2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 136 male individuals, who had been treated in the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao City, were selected to form a new-onset type 2 diabetes group (66 cases) and a control group (70 cases); individuals were divided into three groups (Q1, Q2, and Q3) from low to high according to their anaerobic threshold (AT) oxygen uptake (VO2), AT VO2/kg (VO2 per kg of body weight), peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT heart rate (HR), peak HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. A cardiopulmonary exercise test was used to determine the VO2 of each group of subjects for VO2 max and AT VO2/kg, HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. The differences in fat areas and plasma glucose levels were compared under different cardiorespiratory endurance indicators. Results: Compared with the control group, the abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels increased in the new-onset type 2 diabetes group. Concurrently, AT VO2, AT VO2/kg, peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT HR, peak HR, and 1-minute HR recovery all decreased, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). The higher the AT VO2 and peak VO2 values, the lower the PPG level (P<0.05) and the smaller the area of abdominal visceral fat (P<0.05). The AT VO2/kg and peak VO2/kg values were negatively correlated with the abdominal visceral fat area, while other indicators had no obvious relationship with either plasma glucose levels or the area of fat. Conclusion: The levels of blood glucose and visceral fat are correlated with cardiopulmonary function. With the increase in blood glucose levels and visceral fat, the indices of cardiopulmonary function gradually decrease. The correlation between different cardiopulmonary function indices and blood glucose levels and visceral fat was different. © 2022 Liu et al.",10.2147/DMSO.S352798,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,189,Physiological origin of camera-based PPG imaging," Imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) is a fast-growing technology capable of monitoring human vital signs remotely at low cost. The most remarkable feature of the PPG method is the modulation of the light at the heartbeat frequency after being returned from a biological tissue in-vivo. However, the physiological model of light interaction with pulsatile blood vessels remains a subject of continuing debate. In this chapter, we review various mechanisms responsible for the generation of PPG waveforms. Particular attention is paid to the model recently proposed in our group, which claims that the heart-related light modulation arises from mechanical compression—decompression of the intercapillary tissue due to changes in the transmural arterial pressure. To support this new model, we refer to several recently published experimental observations. The method of imaging PPG allows noninvasive assessment of microvasculature blood flow on the vast surface of the skin and internal organs, both at rest and under various functional tests. An in-depth understanding of the physiological origin of PPG waveforms may enable quantitative characterization of the mechanisms of systemic vascular regulation and solution of the most important problem—the assessment of neurogenic vasomotor reactivity, the value of which is no less important than the neurogenic regulation of heart rhythm to maintain systemic hemodynamic parameters. Based on profound understanding of the physiological mechanism behind PPG, new methods for early diagnosis of socially important diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, systemic sclerosis, skin, stomach, and intestines cancer among others, can be developed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Scopus,190,Non-invasive Glucose Meter System for Monitoring Diabetic Patients using the Photoplethysmographic Signal,"COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan (China) and spread rapidly to many places, generating a worldwide emergency, and causing concern throughout the health system due to its rapid transmission of contagion, leading to a confinement of all people. During the confinement, the lifestyle and eating habits of many people changed, potentially causing diabetes in themselves. This disease occurs when there is a high level of glucose in the blood and this can generate serious problems for the person, as there is no cure for diabetes, it is necessary for patients to control their glucose level, but for this purpose conventional glucometer equipment is used, which generates pain in patients as they introduce a needle into the finger and extract blood to measure glucose. In view of this problem, this article will develop a glucose meter system that does not require introducing a needle into the patient's finger since it will use the photoplestimographic signal generated by the oximetry sensor and can be monitored, so that the system performs the measurement without pain and shows the value of the glucose level accurately, being of immense help to diabetic patients who need to control their glucose several times a day. Through the development of the system, it was observed that the system works in the best way, when comparing the glucose level measurement with other conventional glucometer equipment, a relative error of 4.786% was obtained, being an accepted error because it is close to the real value of the glucose level in the blood. © 2022 International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering.

Scopus,191,Brachial-Ankle Pulse Wave Velocity as a Novel Modality for Detecting Early Diabetic Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetes Patients,"Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) has been shown to correlate with a host of disorders associated with arterial stiffness. Type 2 diabetes is associated with the involvement of both small vessels and large vessels. Studies on the relevance of baPWV to early diabetic nephropathy are scarce. This retrospective observational case-control study enrolled 120 patients with type 2 diabetes from our medical records. We classified patients into two groups depending on the magnitude of albuminuria: 60 patients with microalbuminuria were classified as the early diabetic nephropathy group (EDN group) and 60 patients without albuminuria were classified as the diabetes without nephropathy group (DWN group). An additional 30 nondiabetic age-and sex-matched controls were also enrolled. Data regarding the lipid profile, blood pressure, baPWV, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, anthropometric measurements, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), serum creatinine level, and glycemic control indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c)) were recorded for all enrolled participants. baPWV was significantly higher in the EDN group than in the DWN group. Moreover, baPWV was positively correlated with age, duration of diabetes, obesity, poor glycemic control, and high serum levels of triglycerides (TG), hs-CRP, creatinine, and uric acid as well as a high UACR (all P<0.01). A significant negative correlation was found between baPWV and high-density lipoprotein levels (P<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the hs-CRP level and duration of diabetes most strongly influenced baPWV. baPWV may be a convenient, noninvasive, and reproducible method for detecting early diabetic nephropathy. © 2021 Xueyang Zhang et al.",10.1155/2021/8862573,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,192,A 28μW 134dB DR 2nd-Order Noise-Shaping Slope Light-to-Digital Converter for Chest PPG Monitoring,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a key non-invasive technique to extract vital signs like heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Integrated in smartwatches, health patches and finger clips, PPG sensors are widely used in fitness, glucose, blood pressure, and medical monitoring with good user comfort. Integrating PPG in medical chest patches is interesting for COVID-19 patients since it can yield, next to HR and respiration, also SpO2, which traditional ECG-based patches cannot provide. However, measuring PPG/SpO 2 on the chest is challenging due to large motion artifacts, small AC/DC perfusion index (PI \lt 0.1%), and ambient light. Therefore, it poses a more stringent requirement on dynamic range (DR \gt 120 dB) for the PPG readout circuit, while still requiring low power consumption for long battery life. On-chip pinned-photodiodes (PPDs) have been used as passive integrators, resulting in very low power consumption (2.63 \mu \mathrm{W}) for the PPG readout [1]. However, the DR and linearity can be limited by the PPDs' parasitic capacitors. Direct light-todigital converter (LDC) topologies are proposed in [2 - 4], but their DR is still below 120dB. In [5], a digital-controlled TIA is exploited to control the transimpedance gain, which extends the DR to 130dB while consuming 72 \mu \mathrm{W} in the analog front-end (AFE). © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ISSCC42613.2021.9365757,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,196,Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Estimation System Based on a Neural Network with Dual-Wavelength Photoplethysmography and Bioelectrical Impedance Measuring,"This study proposed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation system based on dualwavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) and bioelectrical impedance measuring technology that can avoid the discomfort created by conventional invasive blood glucose measurement methods while accurately estimating blood glucose. The measured PPG signals are converted into mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, and information entropy. The data obtained by bioelectrical impedance measuring consist of the real part, imaginary part, phase, and amplitude size of 11 types of frequencies, which are converted into features through principal component analyses. After combining the input of seven physiological features, the blood glucose value is finally obtained as the input of the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). To confirm the robustness of the system operation, this study collected data from 40 volunteers and established a database. From the experimental results, the system has a mean squared error of 40.736, a root mean squared error of 6.3824, a mean absolute error of 5.0896, a mean absolute relative difference of 4.4321%, and a coefficient of determination (R Squared, R2) of 0.997, all of which fall within the clinically accurate region A in the Clarke error grid analyses. © 2022 by the authors.

Scopus,197,Application of sample screening method based on single Sigma criterion in spectral noninvasive blood detection,"In the analysis of blood component content, spectral method has been widely concerned for its rapid and non-invasive advantages, but there are many interference factors in the process of data collection, this will cause a large deviation in the spectral data of some samples，if it is directly used in modeling analysis, it will introduce bias to model establishment and result in large deviation in prediction. Therefore, it is necessary to screen the samples before establishing the model, in this paper, a method of sample screening using sigma criterion is proposed for noninvasive blood component analysis, The dynamic spectrum (DS) value was extracted by single edge method which is the mean value of the effective slope of the rising edge of the photoplethysmographic(PPG) signal was taken as the DS value. The DS value fluctuates in a certain range due to the change of blood component concentration. The samples beyond the range of 1 standard deviation were excluded and screened. Partial least squares (PLS) linear regression models were established for fasting blood glucose, white blood cell and albumin in all samples before and after screening, and the whole sample was modeled and analyzed. Then the sample set was divided into training set and test set according to the ratio of 10:1, and the three blood components were predicted and analyzed respectively.

Scopus,198,Edge Classification of Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Levels Based on Photoplethysmography Signals,"Diabetes monitoring systems are critical for avoiding potentially significant medical bills. Only invasive methods are currently on the market. These procedures have substantial drawbacks since they cause patients uncomfortable while collecting blood specimens. An approach checking blood glucose levels (BGL) that is comfortable, continuous, and non-injury will become a new alternative to invasive procedures. Photoplethysmography can identify cardiovascular disease. Because of these qualities, PPG signals directly impact diabetes patients.

Scopus,199,Lower Limb Dynamic Activity Significantly Reduces Foot Skin Perfusion: Exploring Data with Different Optical Sensors in Age-Grouped Healthy Adults,"Introduction: The human lower limb is widely used as a model to study in vivo microcirculatory physiology and pathophysiology. It is a preferential target for critical comorbidities (overweight, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease). Movement and activity are consistently regarded as beneficial, but the related adaptive physiology is still poorly understood. Our goal was to better identify the foot microcirculatory changes after a regular walking gait activity in healthy subjects of different ages. Methods: Twelve healthy participants of both sexes, with normal BMI and Ankle-Brachial Index, were selected and grouped according to age - group I (21.0 ± 1 y.o.) and group II (55.8 ± 3 y.o.). The protocol involved 2 phases of 5-min duration each - phase 1, a static standing position, and phase 2, 5-min walking with a comfortable pace on a pre-established circuit. Perfusion changes were assessed in the dorsal region of both feet before (baseline, phase 1) and after (phase 2) the gait period by noninvasive optical technologies - laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), photoplethysmography, and polarized spectroscopy (PSp). Comparative statistics were performed with a 95% confidence level. Results: All instruments detected an asymmetric nonsignificant perfusion between right and left feet during rest in all participants with values in females consistently lower than men. Older participants exhibited lower baseline values than the younger group. Gait evoked a perfusion reduction in all participants relative to phase 1 detected with all technologies, with statistically significant changes recorded with LDF (group I, p = 0.033, and group II, p = 0.028) and PSp (group II, p = 0.041). Furthermore, LDF revealed that gait significantly reduced perfusion velocity in the older group (p = 0.003). Corresponding changes in the younger group were present but discrete. Recovery to baseline levels was also slower in the older group. Discussion/Conclusions: Our results confirm that perfusion is age dependent and demonstrate the clinical relevance of simple dynamic activities such as gait. This reduction of the dorsal foot perfusion occurs in depth, being more pronounced with the movement intensity, suggesting a wide application potential in early diagnostics as for rehabilitation.  © 2022 S.

Scopus,200,Hemoglobin and glucose level estimation from PPG characteristics features of fingertip video using MGGP-based model,"Hemoglobin and the glucose level can be measured after taking a blood sample using a needle from the human body and analyzing the sample, the result can be observed. This type of invasive measurement is very painful and uncomfortable for the patient who is required to measure hemoglobin or glucose regularly. However, the non-invasive method only needed a bio-signal (image or spectra) to estimate blood components with the advantages of being painless, cheap, and user-friendliness. In this work, a non-invasive hemoglobin and glucose level estimation model have been developed based on multigene genetic programming (MGGP) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) characteristic features extracted from fingertip video captured by a smartphone. The videos are processed to generate the PPG signal. Analyzing the PPG signal, its first and second derivative, and applying Fourier analysis total of 46 features have been extracted. Additionally, age and gender are also included in the feature set. Then, a correlation-based feature selection method using a genetic algorithm is applied to select the best features. Finally, an MGGP based symbolic regression model has been developed to estimate hemoglobin and glucose level. To compare the performance of the MGGP model, several classical regression models are also developed using the same input condition as the MGGP model. A comparison between MGGP based model and classical regression models have been done by estimating different error measurement indexes. Among these regression models, the best results (±0.304 for hemoglobin and ±0.324 for glucose) are found using selected features and symbolic regression based on MGGP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102478,YES,Unique DOI

However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples.

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is one of the early complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of ANS function indicators to screen for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as measured by the TM-Oxi and SudoPath system. Methods: All enrolled participants completed a basic sociodemographic and medical history questionnaire including current medications. Healthy controls (n = 25) underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to evaluate glucose, insulin, and insulin C-peptide. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 24) were assessed with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin. The TM-Oxi and SudoPath system evaluation was completed by all subjects. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22. Frequency and descriptive statistics were calculated on all variables. The criterion for statistical significance was a = 0.05. Results: The twenty-five healthy controls had a mean age of 37.0 years. The twenty-four type 2 diabetes mellitus patients currently undergoing standard treatment had a mean age of 48.9 years. Based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines, we detected pre-diabetes in 4 subjects and diabetes in 1 subject, while all other subjects had normal FPG values. At 120 minutes, the correlations between the OGTT and cardiometabolic risk score (CMRS) were: r = 0.56 (p = 0.004) for glucose and r = 0.53 (p = 0.006) for insulin. At 120 minutes, the correlations between the OGTT and photoplethysmography index (PTGi) were: r = -0.56 (p = 0.003) for glucose and r = -0.41 (p = 0.04) for insulin. The CMRS, PTGi, and plethysmography total power index (PTGVLFi) differed significantly between the diabetes patients and healthy participants. The specificity and sensitivity for the CMRS, PTGi, and PTVLFi comparing the diabetes patients with healthy controls were high. Conclusion: The TM-Oxi and SudoPath system shows promise as a valid, convenient, and non-invasive screening method for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The ANS function and CMR indicators measured by this system may be useful in guiding diabetes and cardiovascular health screening, treatment, and monitoring. © 2014 Lewis et al.",10.1186/s40200-014-0118-x,YES,Unique DOI

Blood pressure is a primary vital sign that must be monitored regularly for the early detection, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement techniques are either invasive or cuff-based, which are impractical, intermittent, and uncomfortable for patients. Over the past few decades, several indirect approaches using photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been investigated, namely, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, pulse arrival time and pulse wave analysis, in an effort to utilise PPG for estimating blood pressure.

Scopus,212,A pilot study on patch sensor based Photo Plethysmography (PPG) for heart rate measurements,"The advent of Integrated Healthcare technology has helped in the development of portable medical devices for measuring vital physiological parameters such as such as Blood glucose and Blood pressure etc. These devices can be afforded by the common man and are readily available in the market. Medical devices of this kind give the firsthand information about the health condition of the patient and also suggests patient if any necessary actions need to be taken based on the observed symptoms. Although several attempts have been made to develop wearable non-invasive medical devices, still there is a huge demand to catch the need of resources constrained population. This paper suggests the design of a wearable patch sensor based on Photo Plethysmography (PPG) unit which can be used as a patch sensor or a wearable device for measuring the heart rate of the patient. The device consists of a sensor developed by Maxim Integrated Circuit for acquiring the PPG signal. The heart rate obtained from the PPG device is communicated serially to Arduino Processor using I2C serial communication, also accelerometer is embedded with the system for detecting undesirable hand movement while measuring heart rate from the signal derived from the PPG device. The Arduino Processor is also connected with the blue tooth model for further communication. The sensor can be placed either in cloth or in thin rubber sheet such that total unit can be tied around the wrist or can be designed place in any other part of the body were PPG signal can be recorded. From the preliminary pilot study, it can be concluded that the proposed patch sensor based PPG yields promising results for the measurement of heart rate. The device needs to be validated with large sample size before introducing to the clinical trial. © 2016 IEEE.",10.1109/CIMCA.2016.8053316,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,213,A novel quantitative method for diabetic cardiac autonomic neuropathy assessment in type 1 diabetic mice,"Background: In this work, we used a sensitive and noninvasive computational method to assess diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) from pulse oximeter (photoplethysmographic; PPG) recordings from mice. The method, which could be easily applied to humans, is based on principal dynamic mode (PDM) analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Unlike the power spectral density, PDM has been shown to be able to separately identify the activities of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems without pharmacological intervention. Method: HRV parameters were measured by processing PPG signals from conscious 1.5- to 5-month-old C57/BL6 control mice and in Akita mice, a model of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, and compared with the gold-standard Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Results: The PDM results indicate significant cardiac autonomic impairment in the diabetic mice in comparison to the controls. When tail-cuff PPG recordings were collected and analyzed starting from 1.5 months of age in both C57/Bl6 controls and Akita mice, onset of DCAN was seen at 3 months in the Akita mice, which persisted up to the termination of the recording at 5 months. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses also showed a reduction in nerve density in Akita mice at 3 and 4 months as compared to the control mice, thus, corroborating our PDM data analysis of HRV records. Conclusions: Western blot analysis of autonomic nerve proteins corroborated the PPG-based HRV analysis via the PDM approach. In contrast, traditional HRV analysis (based on either the power spectral density or time-domain measures) failed to detect the nerve rarefaction. © 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.",10.1177/1932296814545669,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,215,Noninvasive estimation of blood glucose concentration using near infrared optodes,"Early detection of diabetes is indispensable for safer and healthier society as millions of people suffer from diabetes mellitus. Traditionally invasive techniques are used to estimate the concentration of blood glucose. Many efforts have been made to reduce the level of invasiveness of the glucose monitoring by decreasing the blood sample volume. The challenge for non invasive assays is to develop transducers with high sensitivity, capable of detecting weak blood signals that loose energy through intervening tissues (bone, fat, skin etc), and also to separate glucose information from other overlapping blood constituents with much higher concentration (water, haemoglobin, uric acid, urea, proteins). Many biomedical spectroscopy studies have been carried out in the mid infra-red region of the spectrum where the absorbance is high but the cost of the equipment becomes prohibitively high because of the high cost of LED. This chapter deals with the spectroscopic techniques carried out in near infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum to estimate the concentration of blood glucose. The spectroscopy has been performed at the second overtone of glucose which falls in the NIR region. The NIR spectroscopy has been performed based on NIR LED and photo detector constituting an optode pair, using transmission photoplethsymography (PPG). The analog front end system has been implemented to get the PPG signal at the near infra-red wavelengths of 1070nm, 950nm, 935nm. The PPG signal that has been obtained is processed and double regression analysis has been carried out with the artificial neural network for estimating the glucose levels.

Scopus,216,Estimation of blood glucose by non-invasive method using photoplethysmography,"This paper presents a system which estimates blood glucose level (BGL) by non-invasive method using Photoplethysmography (PPG). Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the PPG signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a PPG signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of BGL values. A PPG data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. BGL value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and BGL value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of BGL value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R2 = 0.81. Further, BGL estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for BGL estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6% in class A and 17.4% in class B. 1% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique (SPA) the distribution of data samples are 83% in class A and 17% in class B. The proposed features in SPA have shown significant improvement in R2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. SPA technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.",10.1007/s12046-019-1118-9,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,217,Development and validation of heart rate - Incorporated finger photoplethysmography fitness index algorithm for cardiovascular disease risk assessment,"Cardiovascular disease is a major health problem in developing countries. The risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, sedentary lifestyle and smoking. Many parameters had been produced to monitor cardiovascular disease risk. Finger photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple, low-cost and non-invasive optical method that detects blood volume change in the microvascular bed of the finger. PPG fitness index (PPGF), vascular risk prediction index (VRPI) and estimated vascular age were derived from PPG wave and proposed for assessment of cardiovascular risk. PPGF was produced from AC component of PPG morphological changes against a healthy 19-year-old reference identified from Malaysia population. AC is component of PPG records physiological properties of the arteries. Heart rate (HR) is a known factor that influences vascular function and this factor may affect the PPG parameters. It is important to determine the effect of HR variation on PPGF and to confirm PPGF stability across variable HR so that it will be a valid marker for cardiovascular disease risk. This study aims to develop and validate heart rate-incorporated PPGF algorithm for cardiovascular disease risk assessment.

The goal of the study is to develop a device that can monitor the blood glucose level that would not cause any discomfort to the patients by utilizing reflectance mode photoplethysmography equipped with a filtering technique, Moving Average filter. Initially, the device prompts the user to choose from two categories depending on his condition: diabetic or non-diabetic, and then would choose between the two modes: fasting or post meal mode. The parameters utilized in the study are the force in Newton (N) which corresponds to the applied pressure on the finger, the peak-to-peak voltage (V) of the photopletyhsmography signal, and lastly, the blood glucose level measured in milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). The force is acquired using a force sensitive resistor that is incorporated in the ring. The suggested device employs a photoplethysmography sensor which can diagnose variations on microvascular bed of tissue. The variations in the distribution of blood volume have a significant relation with the measurement of blood glucose level. The technique used to estimate the photoplethysmography in terms of peak-to-peak voltage is the Moving Average filter, and the result is then compared to that of the OneTouch glucometer and Fasting Plasma Glucose.

Scopus,221,Multimodal photoplethysmography-based approaches for improved detection of hypertension,"Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of death, yet hypertension commonly goes undetected. Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010-2019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement. Our literature review reveals promising measurement accuracies and we comment on the effective combinations of modalities and success of this technology. © 2020 by the authors.

Scopus,222,"Joint empirical mode decomposition, exponential function estimation and L1 norm approach for estimating mean value of photoplethysmogram and blood glucose level","Continuous monitoring of the blood glucose levels is essential and critical for controlling diabetes and its complications. With the improvement of the measurement accuracy of the acquisition devices developed in recent decades, developing the optical-based methods for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation for the consumer applications becomes very important. The authors' previous work is based on the heart rate variability of the electrocardiogram and the existing method is based on applying the random forest to the features extracted from the photoplethysmogram. However, the accuracies of these two methods are not very high. In this study, a joint empirical mode decomposition and exponential function estimation approach is proposed for estimating the mean value of a photoplethysmogram acquired from a wearable noninvasive blood glucose device. Also, the exponential function fitting approach is employed for estimating the blood glucose levels via an L1norm formulation. The computer numerical simulation results show that the estimation accuracy based on their proposed method is higher than that based on the state-of-the-art methods.

Scopus,223,"Noninvasive Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose at Your Fingertips, Literally+ACE-: Smartphone-Based Photoplethysmography","Diabetes is a chronic disease and one of the major public health problems worldwide. It is a multifactorial disease, caused by genetic factors and lifestyle habits. Brazil had ∼ 16.8 million individuals living with diabetes in 2019 and is expected to reach 26 million people by 2045. There are global increasing needs for the development of noninvasive diagnostic methods and use of mobile health, mainly in face of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For daily glycemic control, diabetic patients use a portable glucometer for glycemic self-monitoring and need to prick their fingertips three or more times a day, generating a huge discomfort throughout their lives. Our goal here is to present a review with very recent emerging studies in the field of noninvasive diagnosis and to emphasize that smartphone-based photoplethysmography (spPPG), powered by artificial intelligence, might be a trend to self-monitor blood glucose levels. In photoplethysmography, a light source travels through the tissue, interacts with the interstitium and with cells and molecules present in the blood. Reflection of light occurs as it passes through the biological tissues and a photodetector can capture these interactions. When using a smartphone, the built-in flashlight is a white light-emitting LED and the camera works as a photodetector. The higher the concentration of circulating glucose, the greater the absorbance and, consequently, the lesser the reflected light intensity will be. Due to these optical phenomena, the signal intensity captured will be inversely proportional to the blood glucose level. Furthermore, we highlight the microvascular changes in the progression of diabetes that can interfere in the signals captured by the photodetector using spPPG, due to the decrease of peripheral blood perfusion, which can be confused with high blood glucose levels. It is necessary to create strategies to filter or reduce the impact of these vascular changes in the blood glucose level analysis. Deep learning strategies can help the machine to solve these challenges, allowing an accurate blood glucose level and interstitial glucose prediction. © 2020 by Thieme Revinter Publicações Ltda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",10.1055/s-0040-1716498,YES,Unique DOI

However, the pain sensation due to finger pricking is not only an inconvenience to patients, but can also reduce compliance with diabetes management. A reliable, mobile, easy-to-use, and noninvasive glucometer can address this problem. Noninvasive optical signals, such as those used to obtain a photoplethysmogram (PPG), have recently been used to measure human physiological and vascular conditions and have been adopted to estimate glucose. In this study, we conducted a clinical trial to acquire the PPG signals using wearable devices from nine type 2 diabetic patients.

Scopus,226,Investigations on multisensor-based noninvasive blood glucose measurement system,"Noninvasive blood glucose (NIBG) measurement technique has been explored for the last three decades to facilitate diabetes management. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal may be used to measure the variations in blood glucose concentration. However, the literature reveals that physiological perturbations such as temperature, skin moisture, and sweat lead to less accurate NIBG measurements. The task of minimizing the effect of these perturbations for accurate measurements is an important research area. Therefore, in the present work, galvanic skin response (GSR) and temperature measurements along with PPG were used to measure blood glucose noninvasively. The data extracted from the sensors were used to estimate blood glucose concentration with the help of two machine learning (ML) techniques, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy of proposed multisensor system was evaluated by pairing and comparing noninvasive measurements with invasively measured readings.

We computed 1) frame based and 2) single pulse based cepstral coefficients of PPG signal to estimate BGL values. The performance of the frame based and single pulse based technique using CC features for BGL estimation are compared based on four performance metrics namely 1) Coefficient of determination i.e. R2, 2) Spearman's and 3)Pearson coefficient of correlation and 4) Clarke error grid analysis.

Scopus,228,Small intra-individual variability of the preejection period justifies the use of pulse transit time as approximation of the vascular transit,"Background Vascular transit time (VTT) is the propagation time of a pulse wave through an artery; it is a measure for arterial stiffness. Because reliable non-invasive VTT measurements are difficult, as an alternative we measure pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is defined as the time between the R-wave on electrocardiogram and arrival of the resulting pulse wave in a distal location measured with photoplethysmography (PPG). The time between electrical activation of the ventricles and the resulting pulse wave after opening of the aortic valve is called the pre-ejection period (PEP), a component of PTT. The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of PEP at rest, to establish how accurate PTT is as approximation of VTT. Methods PTT was measured and PEP was assessed with echocardiography (gold standard) in three groups of 20 volunteers: 1) a control group without cardiovascular disease aged <50 years and 2) aged >50 years, and 3) a group with cardiovascular risk factors, defined as arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, kidney failure and diabetes mellitus. Results Per group, the mean PEP was: 1) 58.5 ± 13.0 ms, 2) 52.4 ± 11.9 ms, and 3) 57.6 ± 11.6 ms. However, per individual the standard deviation was much smaller, i.e. 1) 2.0-5.9 ms, 2) 2.8-5.1 ms, and 3) 1.6-12.0 ms, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean PEP of the 3 groups (p = 0.236). Conclusion In conclusion, the intra-individual variability of PEP is small. A change in PTT in a person at rest is most probably the result of a change in VTT rather than of PEP. Thus, PTT at rest is an easy, non-invasive and accurate approximation of VTT for monitoring arterial stiffness. © 2018 Kortekaas et al.

If the proper treatment is not taken and the glucose level is not kept within the normal range, it can damage vital organs of the human body. Due to this, it is important to check the blood glucose level regularly. There are different types of invasive glucometers available in the market. These invasive methods need a blood sample which causes pain, time-consuming, and higher cost. For this, a noninvasive method is badly needed.

Scopus,231,Bilateral photoplethysmography for peripheral arterial disease screening in haemodialysis patients using astable multivibrator and machine learning classifier,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is highly prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients with type 2 diabetes. Atherosclerosis may occur in both lower and upper peripheral arteries, causing progressive dialysis access stenosis in HD patients. To assess the risk of PAD, non-invasive bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) can be used to obtain continuous variations in blood flow volume in in vivo examinations. The authors propose an astable multivibrator to model the peripheral circulation system and to produce PPG oscillation with time constants, duty ratio (rising time), and amplitude ratio of systolic and diastolic pressures. Then, the bilateral differences in the time constant and duty ratio are used to separate the normal condition from PAD. The machine learning decision-making process utilises a screening method to automatically detect subjects with and without the risk of PAD. The radial-based function is employed to parameterise the similarity and dissimilarity levels using probability values. Colour relation analysis incorporates the probability values into the perceptual colour relationships for PAD screening. The experimental results indicate that in comparison with bilateral timing parameters, degree of stenosis, and resistive index, the proposed screening method is efficient in preventing complications of PAD and is easily implemented in an embedded system. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Scopus,233,Integrating sphere finger-photoplethysmography: Preliminary investigation towards practical non-invasive measurement of blood constituents,"The aim of this study was to compare conventional photoplethysmography (PPG) in a finger with PPG using an integrating sphere (ISPPG) to enhance scattered light collection. Two representative wavelengths were used; 1160 nm, a window through the absorption spectra of water and alcohol, and 1600 nm around where water absorption is high and there is an absorption peak of blood glucose. Simultaneous transmission-type measurements were made with conventional PPG and with ISPPG for each wavelength in the tips of index fingers of both hands in a total of 10 healthy young male and female volunteers (21.7 ± 1.6 years old). During a 5 min period in which subjects were in a relaxed state we determined the signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and the PPG detectability (or sensitivity) by the two techniques. SNR during the test period was significantly higher with ISPPG as compared with conventional PPG, especially for the 1600 nm wavelength. PPG signals with 1600 nm could scarcely be detected by conventional PPG, while they could be detected with good sensitively by ISPPG. We conclude that under controlled conditions ISPPG has better SNR and higher sensitivity than conventional transmission PPG, especially in wavelength regions where water absorption is high but where there is potential for practical measurement of blood constituents including glucose. © 2015 Yamakoshi et al.

Scopus,239,Difference in bilateral digital volume pulse as a novel non-invasive approach to assessing arteriosclerosis in aged and diabetic subjects: A preliminary study,"Objective: This study aimed at validating photoplethysmography for assessing bilateral blood pressure differences through investigating the correlations of digital volume pulse with arteriosclerosis risk. Methods: Totally, 111 subjects (70 healthy and 41 diabetic) were recruited. Demographic, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. Blood was collected for determining serum cholesterol, total triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. Arterial stiffness was assessed with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, crest time and inter-digital volume pulse differences. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated high inter-digital volume pulse difference sensitivity to glycated haemoglobin level over 6.5%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated significant correlation between inter-digital volume pulse difference and electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity (r = 0.692, p < 0.001). Compared with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, inter-digital volume pulse difference exhibited highly significant correlations with age, glycated haemoglobin level, pulse pressure, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, crest time, high-density lipoprotein and systolic blood pressure (all ps < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated successful application of a novel non-invasive waveform contour index, inter-digital volume pulse difference, in differentiating young from aged subjects and patients with good diabetic control from those with poor diabetic control but also validated its use in identifying arteriosclerosis risks. The results, therefore, endorse its domestic application as non-invasive tool for arteriosclerosis risk screening. © The Author(s) 2017.",10.1177/1479164116688870,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,244,Upper extremity arterial testing: The diagnostic criteria for the physiologic examination,"Upper extremity arterial disease is relatively uncommon compared with lower extremity disease, but presents a unique diagnostic challenge for physicians and technologists. It affects approximately 5–10% of the population. The most common causes of upper extremity arterial disease are atherosclerosis and embolic disease. Some common symptoms of upper arterial disease include dysesthesia, paresthesia, pallor, cold intolerance, ulceration, pain, or weakness in one or both extremities. The vascular system plays a vital role in the delivering of nutrients and clearing metabolic waste products from the peripheral tissues and also helps maintain an individual’s systemic core temperature. In a majority of patients, the deep and superficial palmar arches provide the dominant blood supply to the hand. The arches are a continuation of the radial and ulnar arteries. These arches are typically connected in approximately 80% of patients. In order to accurately diagnose upper extremity arterial disease, a noninvasive upper extremity physiologic examination is of importance to determine treatment options for patients. The physiologic examination includes upper extremity segmental pressures known as wrist-brachial index, Doppler waveforms; digital evaluations include photoplethysmography and pressures of the digits known as the digital-brachial index. Physiologic tests are indirect examinations. The upper extremity arterial physiologic examination is always completed bilaterally in order to determine if the disease is present in one or both extremities and also assists in the diagnosis of disease severity. The vascular physiologic examination should focus on the symptoms presented by the patient during the history. However, a complete vascular examination is appropriate given the diffuse nature of the atherosclerotic disease process. © 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

Scopus,245,Evaluation of arterial properties through acceleration photoplethysmogram,"This work aimes to provide, that acceleration photoplethysmogram produces useful information in assessing arterial properties. The development and progression of arterial vascular disease is a multifactorial process. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease mediate their effects by altering the structure, properties and function of wall and endothelial components of the arterial blood vessels that vary between different vascular beds. Monitoring arterial vascular walls as well as risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and other blood biochemical profiles can potentially help to identify individuals having an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Pulse wave analysis has been shown to provide valuable information on aortic stiffness and elasticity, and it has been widely used to evaluate the vascular effects of aging, hypertension and atherosclerosis. The second derivative of the PPG or acceleration photoplethysmogram (APG) was developed as a method allowing more accurate recognition of the inflection points and easier interpretation of the original plethysmogram wave. Although obtained from the periphery of the circulation, APG provides information about both central and peripheral arterial properties. A computer based PPG analyzer was developed. With the APG signal, four separate systole waves (named a-d) and a diastole wave (named e) were obtained. A study with 40 people, 20 healthy volunteers and 20 subjects with previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease (diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, hypertension) was carried out. A t-tested distribution between healthy volunteers and patients showed a significant differences in calculated parameters: b/a (-0.742 vs -0.361, p <0.0001), d/a (-0.083 vs -0.482, p < 0.0001), e/a (0.182 vs 0.061, p< 0.0001), and for c/a (-0.039 vs -0.148, p < 0.005).

Scopus,249,Non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose using optical methods for skin spectroscopy—opportunities and recent advances,"Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease with greatly rising patient numbers expected in the future, not only for industrialized countries but also for regions in the developing world. There is a need for efficient therapy, which can be via self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to provide tight glycemic control for reducing the risks of severe health complications. Advancements in diabetes technology can nowadays offer different sensor approaches, even for continuous blood glucose monitoring. Non-invasive blood glucose assays have been promised for many years and various vibrational spectroscopy-based methods of the skin are candidates for achieving this goal. Due to the small spectral signatures of the glucose hidden among a largely variable background, the largest signal-to-noise ratios and multivariate calibration are essential to provide the method applicability for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Besides multiparameter approaches, recently presented devices based on photoplethysmography with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared range are evaluated for their potential of providing reliable blood glucose concentration predictions.

We used wavelet transform to study the microcirculatory regulatory mechanism in three different groups (18-diabetic, 8-peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 14 healthy controls) using toe photoplethysmogram (PPG) and 11 different features were derived. Compared to healthy subjects we obtained a significant decrease in the neurogenic (VNe: 286.41 vs. 125.29 (a. u), p-value = 0.000), myogenic (VMe: 281.55 vs. 29.02, p-value = 0.000) and respiratory activity (VRe: 37.68 vs. 9.35, p-value = 0.022) in the diabetic group and significant increase in the cardiac activity (VCe: 19.69 vs. 33.89, p-value = 0.007) in PAD group.

Scopus,251,Large Artery Dysfunction in Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the arterial distensibility of large vessels and changes in microvasculature in primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Methods Twenty-two antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) patients and 66 age-, sex-, height-, and blood pressure-matched controls were evaluated. Second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) was used as a noninvasive method to evaluate the pulse wave. The b/a and d/a indices, which reflect, respectively, large-vessel and small-vessel properties, were calculated from the SDPTG waveform components. Vascular age index was also determined. Results Arterial thrombosis occurred in 59.1% (13/22) of APL patients, with a predominance of stroke episodes (61.5%). Venous thromboembolism was observed in 36.4% (all deep venous thrombosis), and obstetric complications in 36.4%. Frequency of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia was comparable in APL patients and control subjects (P > 0.05). Concerning plethysmography findings, b/a ratio was higher in patients than in control subjects (-0.44 ± 0.16 vs.-0.54 ± 0.18, P = 0.034), whereas d/a ratio (-0.30 ± 0.16 vs.-0.31 ± 0.18, P = 0.83) was comparable. Moreover, SDPTG (-0.16 ± 0.35 vs.-0.30 ± 0.38, P = 0.16) and vascular age index values (53.5 ± 11.6 vs. 51.8 ± 16.1, P = 0.65) were alike in both groups. Regarding disease-related factors, patients with arterial and venous thrombosis had similar b/a, d/a, and vascular age indices (P = 0.95; P = 0.06; P = 0.12, respectively). Conclusions The higher b/a ratio in APL patients suggests decreased distensibility of large arteries and may be why APL patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular events. The d/a ratio, that is considered a marker of small vessel vascular resistance, was not different than controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate vascular factors that predispose APL patients to atherosclerotic events. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Scopus,256,Estimation of Blood Glucose from PPG Signal Using Convolutional Neural Network,"The purpose of this paper is to develop a system that can measure the blood glucose level in a non-invasive way. Since blood glucose is an important indicator of health issues, frequent blood glucose measurement is required by a great number of people. Non-invasive methods are getting popular for such measurements since painful collection of blood is not required. In non-invasive methods, blood glucose level is recorded by exploiting the relationship of blood glucose level with various biological signals and parameters. This paper addresses the relationship of glucose level with PPG (photoplethysmoram) signal which can provide information regarding the volume of blood flowing in the test region through exposure of that particular region to infrared light of certain wavelengths. A dataset has been created by collecting the PPG signal of 30 people along with their blood glucose level, measured in invasive way both before and 2 hours after breakfast. A CNN model has been trained with this dataset to exploit the relationship of glucose level with PPG signal and thus the glucose level of blood have been measured.

The sensitivity of the new device was compared with that of a conventional transmittance-type sensor (tmFPPG). We used near-infrared light at 1160-nm, a window in the water absorption spectrum and strong BAL absorption peak, and 1600-nm, a strong absorption peak of BGL. In 8 volunteers, simultaneous measurements of both isFPPG and tmFPPG from the index fingers with both wavelengths were made using a laser-based experimental setup. The difference of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) between isFPPG and tmFPPG were evaluated. We found statistically significant higher SNRs with the isFPPG, by factors of 1.58 and 4.80 for the FPPG measurements at 1160-nm and 1600-nm, respectively.

Scopus,259,Noninvasive Diagnostic Methods for Better Screening of Peripheral Arterial Disease,"Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to extremities, usually legs. It does not receive enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain while walking which is known as claudication. It is a common manifestation of type-2 Diabetes, but the relationship between other vascular diseases and lower limb peripheral arterial disease (LLPAD) has been poorly understood and investigated. Methods: When assessing a patient with clinical LLPAD, 2 methods are used to establish a diagnosis: one is noninvasive testing and other is invasive. Invasive methods are painful and get so bad that some people need to have a leg surgery. People with diabetes are at increased risk for amputation, and it is used only when the damage is very severe. Results: Diagnosis of LLPAD begins with a physical examination, patient history, and certain questionnaire, and noninvasive mode of diagnosis is started for the screening of patients. Clinicians check for weak pulses in the legs and then decide for further diagnosis. This article discusses the prevalence of LLPAD worldwide and in India, along with the clinical effectiveness and limitations of these methods in case of diabetes. Conclusions: The focus of this review is to discuss only those noninvasive methods that are widely used for screening of LLPAD, such as ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and use of photoplethysmogram (PPG) especially in case of diabetic patients. Also, this article gives an overview of the work carried out using ABI, TBI, and PPG for detection of LLPAD.

Pulse photoplethysmography signal is acquired from 611 human subjects and used for the analysis. Time and frequency domain features are extracted using (1) Frame based and (2) Single Pulse Analysis technique. These two features are used as input to train neural network, Support vector machines and Random forest models. These trained models are used for the estimation of BGL values. The BGL estimation performance of these models, (i) neural network, (ii) SVM, (iii) RF and (iv) K-fold RF are compared based on two feature sets i.e. Frame based time and frequency domain features and Single Pulse Analysis based time and frequency domain features. The performance of each system model is evaluated on the basis of, (i) Coefficient of determination i.e. R2, (ii) Spearman’s coefficient of correlation, (iii) Pearson’s coefficient of correlation and (iv) Clarke error grid analysis. We observed that Single Pulse Analysis technique shows better performance as compared to Frame based technique. The highest R2 value (0.95) for Single Pulse analysis is obtained for K-fold RF network. For Single Pulse Analysis, all other models also show comparable BGL estimation accuracy with R2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.94.

Scopus,263,Side-scattered finger-photoplethysmography: Experimental investigations toward practical noninvasive measurement of blood glucose,"The aim of this study was to discover a simple/convenient geometrical arrangement of radiation sources and detector to acquire finger-photoplethysmograms (PPGs) with wavelength regions of blood glucose (BGL) absorption, toward practical noninvasive BGL measurement. First, we compared PPGs with three wavelengths: 808 nm (without water absorption), 1160 nm (with weak water absorption), and 1600 nm (with nearly peak BGL absorption and strong water absorption), while the source-detector spacing was successively increased circumferentially around a fingertip. In 10 healthy subjects, we observed clear cardiac-related pulsatile components of PPG signals at 808 and 1160 nm in any incident positions with more than 15 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), but reliable PPG detections at 1600 nm with more than 10 dB of S/N was only possible when the source-detector distance was less than 3 mm around the fingertip circumference. Second, with this arrangement, an experiment was performed using six wavelengths to cover glucose absorption bands (from 1550 to 1749 nm), obtaining pulsatile PPG signals with more or less 15 dB of S/N. Through the present experiments, this orthogonal arrangement of the source and detector to detect forward- and side-scattered radiation through the tissue is appropriate for PPG measurements with wavelength regions where there is potential for BGL measurement. © The Authors.

Scopus,264,Design and Implementation of a Wearable System for Non-Invasive Glucose Level Monitoring,"Among current issues that are challenging to be dealt with in medical science, Diabetes is a noteworthy one. A good number of invasive techniques to measure blood glucose levels have been devised in the past few decades that had been a mixed blessing because it carried multiple limitations along with beneficial sides. Pain, discomfort, and risks of pathogenic infection were some of the basic drawbacks. So, per the demand of time, our main objective of this paper is to introduce a method of blood glucose level measurement that is non-invasive and can overcome the former limitations with better accuracy in a very cost-effective way. Blood glucose concentration can be measured using the PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal. But to gain higher accuracy we need to consider the physiological variations which lead to erroneous measurement of glucose levels. Using GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) sensor data, these perturbations can be minimized. So, in our model PPG sensor and GSR sensor have been used to accurately measure blood glucose levels. Extracted data from these two sensors as well as recorded blood glucose measurement using conventional glucometer were applied in a deep learning algorithm to measure blood glucose level non-invasively. Then the output of our proposed system was compared to conventional invasive technique. The results showed that our proposed multi sensor-based system improves prediction error of glucose level. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/BECITHCON48839.2019.9063193,YES,Unique DOI

Patients with PVO disease have decreased walking capability and life quality in diabetes mellitus and poor peripheral circulation of PVO causes morbidity like infection and amputation of the legs or feet of diabetics. This progressively vascular occlusion is often ignored by the patients and primary care physicians in early stage. Therefore, a reliable method of diagnostic assistance is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring of PVO and prevention of amputation. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for detecting blood volume changes in peripheral vascular bed. Literature indicates that the pulse transit time increases and waveform shape changes increase in PPG of the vascular occlusion. PPG pulses of feet gradually become asynchronous due to the different speed of deteriorating patency and collateral circulation in the peripheral arteries. We utilized synchronizing chaotification to compare the bilateral similarity and asymmetry of PPG signals, and applied SVM to estimate three degrees of PVO. Among 33 subjects tested, this classification technique could recognize various butterfly motion patterns representing severities successfully including normal condition, lower-degree disease, and higher-degree disease. The proposed method has potential for providing diagnostic assistance for PVO of diabetics and other high-risk populations, with efficiency and higher accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Scopus,266,Type 2 diabetes screening test by means of a pulse oximeter,"In this paper, we propose a method for screening for the presence of type 2 diabetes by means of the signal obtained from a pulse oximeter. The screening system consists of two parts: the first analyzes the signal obtained from the pulse oximeter, and the second consists of a machine-learning module. The system consists of a front end that extracts a set of features form the pulse oximeter signal. These features are based on physiological considerations. The set of features were the input of a machine-learning algorithm that determined the class of the input sample, i.e., whether the subject had diabetes or not. The machine-learning algorithms were random forests, gradient boosting, and linear discriminant analysis as benchmark. The system was tested on a database of 1157 subjects (two samples per subject) collected from five community health centers. The mean receiver operating characteristic area found was 69.4% (median value 71.9% and range 75.4-61.1%), with a specificity = 64% for a threshold that gave a sensitivity = 65%.

There is a need to develop a non-invasive monitoring system that avoids the risk of infection problems and pain caused by invasive monitoring techniques. This paper presents a method for developing a noninvasive technique to predict the blood glucose concentration (BCG) based on the Near-infrared (NIR) light sensor.

Scopus,269,A digital biomarker of diabetes from smartphone-based vascular signals,"The global burden of diabetes is rapidly increasing, from 451 million people in 2019 to 693 million by 20451. The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity2. Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the ‘primary cohort’), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the ‘contemporary cohort’) and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the ‘clinic cohort’). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750–0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723–0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P ≤ 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",10.1038/s41591-020-1010-5,YES,Unique DOI

This study aimed at investigating the validity of applying non-invasive photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform parameters in detecting diabetes-induced subtitle changes in arterial stiffness. Between July 2009 and October 2010, totally 94 middle-aged and elderly subjects were recruited including 48 without diabetes (Group 1) and 46 with the disease (Group 2). Demographic (i.e., age, gender), anthropometric (body-mass index), biochemical (i.e., glycated hemoglobin concentration), and hemodynamic (i.e., systolic blood pressure, heart rate) parameters were obtained. Crest time (CT) and crest time ratio (CTR) computed from PPG signals acquired from left index finger were compared with left index finger pulse wave velocity (PWVfinger) obtained from six-channel ECG-PWV system to investigate the differences between the two groups and the associations of these indices with the parameters of testing subjects. Significant difference was only noted in CTR between the two groups (P < 0.005). Despite correlation of both CT and CTR with age, only CTR demonstrated significant associations with hemodynamic parameters. CTR could differentiate diabetic patients from healthy individuals despite absence of difference in arterial stiffness assessed by conventional PWV, highlighting its superior sensitivity to subtle changes in diabetes-associated arteriosclerosis. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10916-018-0901-1,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,275,Detection of type-2 diabetes using characteristics of toe photoplethysmogram by applying support vector machine,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most widespread and rapidly growing diseases. With its advancement, DM-related complications are also increasing. We used characteristic features of toe photoplethysmogram for the detection of type-2 DM using support vector machine (SVM). We collected toe PPG signal, from 58 healthy and 83 type-2 DM subjects. From each PPG signal 37 different features were extracted for further classification. To improve the performance of SVM and reduce the noisy data we employed hybrid feature selection technique that reduces the feature set of 37 to 10 on the basis of majority voting. Using 10 selected features set, we gained an accuracy of 97.87%, sensitivity of 98.78% and specificity of 96.61%.

Scopus,276,The spectral analysis of photoplethysmography to evaluate an independent cardiovascular risk factor,"Background: In this study, we evaluate homeostatic markers correlated to autonomic nervous and endothelial functions in a population of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients versus a control group. Since CAD is the highest risk marker for sudden cardiac death, the study objective is to determine whether an independent cardiovascular risk score based on these markers can be used alongside known conventional cardiovascular risk markers to strengthen the understanding of a patient’s vascular state.; Materials and methods: Sixty-five subjects (13 women) with a mean age of 62.9 years (range 40–80 years) who were diagnosed with CAD using coronary angiography (group 1) and seventy-two subjects (29 women) with a mean age of 45.1 years (range 18–85 years) who claimed they were healthy (group 2) were included in the study. These subjects underwent examination with the TM-Oxi and SudoPath systems at IPC Heart Care Centers in Mumbai, India. The TM-Oxi system takes measurements from a blood pressure device and a pulse oximeter. The SudoPath measures galvanic skin response to assess the sudomotor pathway function. Spectral analysis of the photoplethysmograph (PTG) waveform and electrochemical galvanic skin response allow the TM-Oxi and SudoPath systems to calculate several homeostatic markers, such as the PTG index (PTGi), PTG very low frequency index (PTGVLFi), and PTG ratio (PTGr). The focus of this study was to evaluate these markers (PTGi, PTGVLFi, and PTGr) in CAD patients against a control group, and to calculate an independent cardiovascular risk factor score: the PTG cardiovascular disease risk score (PTG CVD), calculated solely from these markers. We compared PTGi, PTGVLFi, PTGr, and PTG CVD scores between the CAD patient group and the healthy control group. Statistical analyses were performed using receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the markers to detect CAD at optimal cutoff values for PTGi, PTGVLFi, PTGr, and PTG CVD. In addition, correlation analyses between these markers and conventional autonomic nervous system and endothelial function markers were performed to understand the possible underlying physiological sources of the differences observed in marker values between CAD patients and healthy control patients. Additionally, t-tests were performed between two subgroups of the CAD patient group to determine whether diabetic or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients have significantly different PTGi marker values.; Results: Each spectral analysis PTG marker yielded a high specificity and sensitivity to detect CAD. Most notably, the PTG CVD score had a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 96.8%, at a cutoff of 2, when used to detect CAD (P=0.0001; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =0.967). The PTG spectral analysis markers were well-correlated to other autonomic nervous system and endothelial function markers. CAD diabetic patients (n=27) had a lower PTGi value compared with the CAD non-diabetic patients (n=38): and patients that underwent CABG (n=18) had a higher PTGi value compared with the CAD without CABG surgery patients (n=47).; Conclusion: The spectral analysis of the photoplethysmography method is noninvasive, fast, operator-independent, and cost-effective, as only an oximeter and galvanic skin response device are required in order to assess in a single testing the autonomic nervous system and endothelial function. The spectral analysis techniques used on the photoplethysmogram, as outlined in this study, could be useful when used alongside conventional known cardiovascular disease risk markers. © 2014 Gandhi and Rao.",10.2147/IJGM.S70892,YES,Unique DOI

Recent evidences, however, suggest that the value of glycemia at 1 h during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a stronger predictor for developing diabetes than the value at 2 h and that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Studies in cells, animals, and humans suggest that 1-h high glucose is a sufficient stimulus for increasing several cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction, with oxidative stress generation as the possible pathogenetic factor. One-hour glucose might be more dangerous than that at 2 h simply because glycemia is higher at 1 h, during an OGTT and postmeal.

Scopus,288,Anew arterial mechanical property indicator reflecting differences in invasive stimulus intensity induced by alteration of remifentanil concentration during laryngoscopy,"BACKGROUND: Reliable analgesia monitoring is not available for general anaesthesia cases. In 2003, we introduced a method to characterise arterial mechanical properties, which we termed arterial stiffness (K). However, it is unclear whether differences in K actually indicate changes in the intensity of a noxious stimulus. Thus, we examined the relationship between stress intensity and the value of K. METHODS: Thirty patients under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two remifentanil concentration groups (2 and 6 ng/mL). After a steady concentration of remifentanil was achieved for at least 3 minutes, laryngoscopy was performed. After completion of laryngoscopy, once the K value returned to near-baseline, laryngoscopy with endotracheal intubation was performed, and the value of K after the procedure was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, data were obtained for 28 of 30 patients. The values of K before the laryngoscopy were not significantly different between the groups (2 ng/mL group: 13.1 [8.5-33.1] mmHg/%; 6 ng/mL group: 11.6 [4.3-31.4] mmHg/%; P=0.53). After laryngoscopy, K was approximately 2 times greater in the 2 ng/mL group than in the 6 ng/mL group (39.0 [13.6-115.9] mmHg/% vs. 19.0 [5.5-85.1] mmHg/%, P=0.02). After intubation also, K was approximately 2 times greater in the 2 ng/mL group (52.0 [27.7-122.0] mmHg/% vs. 24.3 [7.2-94.9] mmHg/%, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The value for arterial stiffness (K) non-proportionally changes in response to stimulus intensity; therefore, it has the potential to be used as an indicator of nociceptive stimulation intensity. © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",10.23736/S0375-9393.17.11796-7,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,291,Analysis and design of a photoplethysmograph for glucose measurement using near-infrared spectroscopy analyzing human body physical and functional variables,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that increases blood glucose levels. Glucose measurement devices, called glucometers, normally use invasive techniques. These devices are used by the patients themselves. They are small size and require a lancing device to extract a drop of blood and pinpoint the glucose concentration present, This technique is uncomfortable and painful for the patient when continuous blood glucose monitoring is required throughout the day. To improve glucose measurement conditions, non-invasive blood glucose meters have been proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy. The problem that occurs when using the near-infrared spectroscopy method is the physical and functional characteristics of the human body, which interact with the light emitted making it difficult to measure glucose levels, These characteristics are, for example, the fat, pressure, humidity, temperature, among others.  © 2020 IEEE.",10.1109/ROPEC50909.2020.9258674,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,292,Comparative accuracy of optical sensor-based wearable system for non-invasive measurement of blood glucose concentration,"Non-invasive biosensors for indirect evaluation of routinely-measured blood components by sweat analysis have broad potential clinical applications. This trial tested a wrist-borne non-invasive glucose monitor (NIGM) to measure blood glucose (BG) levels using photoplethysmographic (PPG) optical sensors. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of the device in comparison with a standard, invasive clinical method for blood glucose monitoring. Adult participants (n = 200) of both sexes from 18 to 75 were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria: hemophilia and other serious coagulation disorders, impaired venous access, other serious medical conditions. A biosensor was placed on the right wrist of each participant for a non-invasive indirect BG measurement. In parallel, blood from the antecubital vein was collected and glucose levels were assessed with YSI 2300 Bioanalyzer. The measurements were performed twice: before and after food intake, with a 1-h interval between measurements. There were no limitations to food type and quantity. In both anteprandial (ρ = 0.8994, p < 0.0001) and postprandial (ρ =0.9382, p < 0.0001) glucose measurements, NIGM correlated with values obtained by the YSI 2300 reference device – there was no significant difference between the two methods. Plotted on a Parkes Error Grid for Type II diabetes, NIGM readings did not deviate from those of the YSI 2300 in any clinically-significant way, with the majority of correlated readings falling within Parkes zone A. Very few readings fell within Parkes zone B. In anteprandial measurements, the mean bias between methods for all patient volunteers was 3.705 ± 7.838. In postprandial measurements gave a mean bias of 1.362 ± 10.15 for all patient glucose data. The mean absolute relative difference of currently available glucometer models ranges from 5.6% to 20.8%. The NIGM falls in the lower end of this error range at 7.40–7.54%, indicating that PPG-chemochrome sensors are capable of producing results comparable with those of direct measure glucometers. Data presented here demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the NIGM system as an adjunctive, and perhaps substitutive, non-invasive tool for blood glucose monitoring. © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.12.014,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,293,Comparison of Infrared and Red Photoplethysmography signals for Non-calibrated Non-invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring,"Millions of people around the world are affected with diabetes and it is increasing day by day. Non invasive mode of glucose monitoring based on Near infrared (IR) spectroscopy using photoplethysmograph is a promising idea for frequent glucose monitoring and thereby decreasing the risk of diabetic complications. Present non invasive devices in the market are calibrated devices and are very costly. Also they have not looked at the diabetic correlation between IR and Red photoplethys-mography (PPG) signals. In this paper we have developed a glucose prediction algorithm for a non-calibrated non-invasive device that uses PPG signals for getting diabetic correlation. For this we studied the correlation of IR and Red signals with blood glucose and analysed its trend. We compared average amplitude as well as peak amplitude of IR and R signals using a dataset of 172 patients. Our results demonstrate that the current PPG device precision may not be able to pick up the minute variations in the amplitude caused by the change in blood glucose levels, and hence a more precise approach may be required.  © 2020 IEEE.",10.1109/TENSYMP50017.2020.9230743,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,294,A Noninvasive Glucose Monitoring SoC Based on Single Wavelength Photoplethysmography,"Conventional glucose monitoring methods for the growing numbers of diabetic patients around the world are invasive, painful, costly and, time-consuming. Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR). The PPG readout circuit consists of a switched capacitor Transimpedance amplifier with 1 MΩ gain and a 10-Hz switched capacitor LPF. It allows a DC bias current rejection up to 20 μA with an input-referred current noise of 7.3 pA/√Hz. The proposed digital processor eliminates motion artifacts, and baseline drifts from PPG signal, extracts six distinct features and finally predicts the blood glucose level using Support Vector Regression with Fine Gaussian kernel (FGSVR) MLR. A novel piece-wise linear (PWL) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the FGSVR on-chip. The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with a chip area of 4.0 mm2 while consuming 1.62 mW. The glucose measurements are performed for 200 subjects with R2 of 0.937. The proposed system accurately predicts the sugar level with a mean absolute relative difference (mARD) of 7.62%. © 2007-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TBCAS.2020.2979514,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,296,A new method for the assessment of endothelial function with peripheral arterial volume,"Background: Currently, many methodological approaches have been developed to assess peripheral endothelial function. However, a development of the noninvasive and automated technique for routinely assessing endothelial function is still required. We evaluated the potential value of a new method to measure peripheral endothelial function with reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial volume (RH-PAV) in patients with chest pain. Methods: We used a novel oximeter-like probe to detect the peripheral arterial volume (PAV) of the finger and compared it with brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) performed in 93 consecutive patients with chest pain. The RH-PAV index was defined as the ratio of the digital pulse volume during reactive hyperemia relative to the baseline. Results: Ninety-three patients (53 men, 58 ± 5 years) completed the study, and 53 patients demonstrated coronary artery disease (CAD) following scheduled coronary angiography. There was a moderate linear relationship between PAV and FMD (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). Similar to FMD, PAV was more impaired in patients who have more cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs). The subjects with CAD had lower PAV and FMD, compared with those without CAD (1.05 ± 0.23 VS. 1.41 ± 0.37, p < 0.01; 6.7% ± 2.9% VS. 10.4% ± 2.9%, p < 0.01, respectively), and the relationships between FMD and PAV were also significant in both CAD (r = 0.54, p < 0.01) and non-CAD (r = 0.62, p < 0.01) patients. Conclusions: Endothelial function of digital artery assessed with the novel PAV method demonstrated a profile similar to that of brachial artery measured with FMD. The hyperemia PAV was decreased by factors which were considered to impair endothelial function, suggesting that PAV has the potential to be a novel method to study endothelial function. © 2018 The Author(s).",10.1186/s12872-018-0821-5,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,297,Calibration of an optical sensor for in vivo blood glucose maeasurenaent,"The aim of this paper is to design and development of an optical sensor for non-invasive blood glucose measurement and calibrates that sensor for skin colour, finger thickness and blood volume. In this project, a non-invasive device is designed to detect the absorption of infra-red radiations through the finger to extract Photoplethysmogram (PPG). By utilizing a couple of infrared transmitter and receiver a photoplethysmogram is gotten. The streaming blood in the finger is consumed by infrared radiation which emanates through an infrared transmitter. This assimilated radiation is returned via finger and recognized over that infrared receiver. Here, the signal got remains tiny consequently to get the accurate extraction of the signal, the offset mix of resistors and capacitors are needed. This device involves a couple of detector and receiver combined with an amplifier and filter circuit. Also, a TL084 operational amplifier is utilized. Due to weakened signal acquired from the finger, the amplification is significant. Because of the different phases of signal extraction and amplification, random noise is added. So to remove certain noises Butterworth low pass and high pass filter, a notch filter circuit is used. The data is converted using ATMEGA328 Microcontroller. Further, this data is analyzed in MATLAB and the relationship within voltage and blood glucose concentration is determined. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/ICICICT46008.2019.8993348,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,299,PerDMCS: Weighted fusion of PPG signal features for robust and efficient diabetes mellitus classification,"Non-invasive detection of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has attracted a lot of interest in the recent years in pervasive health care. In this paper, we explore features related to heart rate variability (HRV) and signal pattern of the waveform from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal for classifying DM (Type 2). HRV features includes time-domain (F1), frequency domain (F2), non-linear features (F3) where as waveform features (F4) are one set of features such as height, width, slope and durations of pulse. The study was carried out on 50 healthy subjects and 50 DM patients. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to capture the discriminative information between the above mentioned healthy and DM categories, from the proposed features. The SVM models are developed separately using different sets of features F1, F2, F3,and F4, respectively. The classification performance of the developed SVM models using time-domain, frequency domain, non-linear and waveform features is observed to be 73%, 78%, 80% and 77%. The performance of the system using combination of all features is 82%. In this work, the performance of the DM classification system by combining the above mentioned feature sets with different percentage of discriminate features from each set is also examined. Furthermore weight based fusion is performed using confidence values obtained from each model to find the optimal set of features from each set with optimal weights for each set. The best performance accuracy of 89% is obtained by scores fusion where combinations of mixture of 90% features from the feature sets F1 and F2 and mixture of 100% features from the feature sets F3 and F4, with fusion optimal weights of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively.

Scopus,300,Evaluation on noninvasive blood components measurement based on photolepthysmography,"To evaluate the precision level of Photolepthysmography(PPG) in detection of the main components of human blood, the formula for the limit resolution concentration of material components measurement was given based on the Lambert-Beer's Law and simplified measurement model of PPG. Through the evaluation of three elements-Signal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) of light intensity, optical path and the molar extinction coefficient of the blood components during human measurements, the theoretical limit resolution concentrations of the pulse oximeter signal method for hemoglobin, albumin and blood glucose were obtained. The evaluation result shows that the limit resolution concentration levels of hemoglobin, albumin and blood glucose which can be measured through PPG are respectively 100 mg/dL, 5000 mg/dL and 10 000 mg/dL. The comparison of the evaluation result with the detection precision needed on clinic at the present stage indicates that the PPG can meet the demands for the non-invasive detection of hemoglobin. © 2016, Science Press.

Scopus,301,Skin perfusion pressure of the foot is a good substitute for toe pressure in the assessment of limb ischemia,"Purpose: Noninvasive measurements of limb systolic pressures are used routinely in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease, including the evaluation for critical limb ischemia. However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured. Methods: Measurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning. Results: There was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P < .01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P < .01 in both cases). Conclusions: We concluded that SPP measured in the foot correlates well with toe pressure and can be substituted for toe pressure measurement in patients in whom toe pressures cannot be measured.",10.1067/mva.2000.107310,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,306,A noninvasive measure of baroreflex sensitivity without blood pressure measurement,"Background: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV) are attenuated in cardiovascular disease and can give important prognostic information. Conventional measures of BRS require expensive or invasive equipment for the beat-to-beat measure of blood pressure (BP). We examined the possibility of developing a simple protocol that would provide a relatively standardized BP stimulus, which might obviate the need to measure BP beat-by-beat. Methods and Results: Fifty-five patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 59 [SD 11] years) and 20 healthy control subjects (mean age 53 [SD 14] years, P not significant) underwent 5-minute recordings of BP (by photoplethysmograph) and R-R interval during 0.1-Hz controlled breathing. The size of the oscillations in BP was the same in the 2 groups (3.6 mm Hg vs 4.1 mm Hg, P = .5). There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations (77 ms vs 31 ms, P < .0001). The amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations correlated strongly with BRS (r = 0.81, P < .0001 with controlled breathing BRS, and r = 0.51, P < .0001 with α index). There was no correlation with the size of BP oscillations (r = -0.13, P not significant with controlled breathing BRS, and r = -0.15, P not significant with α index). In a separate study, a group of 22 young patients (mean age 36 years) with type I diabetes mellitus and 28 healthy control subjects (mean age 39 years) underwent measurement of resting HRV and amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during 0.1-Hz breathing. There was no significant difference in triangular index or low-frequency R-R interval power between the 2 groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during controlled breathing between patients with diabetes and healthy control subjects. Total and high-frequency RR interval variability was also significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: During 0.1-Hz breathing, the marked difference in BRS between patients with CHF and age-matched control subjects is the result of smaller R-R interval oscillations. In young patients with diabetes, these R-R interval oscillations are significantly smaller than age-matched control subjects, even when some measures of spontaneous HRV are not different between groups. Breathing at 0.1 Hz provides a standard BP stimulus and concentrates spectral power of heart rate at one frequency, enabling simple evaluation of BRS even when BP measurement is not available.",10.1067/mhj.2002.121263,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,308,Dynamic analysis with a fractional-order chaotic system for estimation of peripheral arterial disease in diabetic foot,"Lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is caused by narrowing or occlusion of vessels in patients like type 2 diabetes mellitus, the elderly and smokers. Patients with PAD are mostly asymptomatic; typical early symptoms of this limb-threatening disorder are intermittent claudication and leg pain, suggesting the necessity for accurate diagnosis by invasive angiography and ankle-brachial pressure index. This index acts as a gold standard reference for PAD diagnosis and categorizes its severity into normal, low-grade and high-grade, with respective cut-off points of ≥0.9, 0.9-0.5 and <0.5. PAD can be assessed using photoplethysmography as a diagnostic screening tool, displaying changes in pulse transit time and shape, and dissimilarities of these changes between lower limbs. The present report proposed photoplethysmogram with fractional-order chaotic system to assess PAD in 14 diabetics and 11 healthy adults, with analysis of dynamic errors based on various butterfly motion patterns, and color relational analysis as classifier for pattern recognition. The results show that the classification of PAD severity among these testees was achieved with high accuracy and efficiency.

Scopus,309,Measurement of stiffness index by digital volume pulse analysis technique: Clinical utility in cardiovascular disease risk stratification,"Background: Indices of arterial stiffness are accepted as independent markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), having both positive prognostic and diagnostic implications. The utility of stiffness index (SI) derived from digital volume pulse (DVP) analysis in CVD risk screening is not established. Methods: Using a representative sample of individuals from local communities (West Midlands, UK), we determined the performance of SI in the discrimination of increasing CVD risk. Arterial stiffness was measured by DVP photoplethysmography (PCA 2; Micro Medical) using a direct, standardized approach. CVD risk assessment was performed in accordance with the Joint British Society guidelines (JBS2). Results: Of our cohort of 247 individuals (51% male; mean age 55.2 (s.d. 10.3) years), 187 were apparently healthy and 60 had established CVD risk factors (diabetes mellitus: 33%, hypertension: 77.8%, hypercholesteremia: 61%). On univariate analysis, SI was strongly associated with CVD risk (the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) based HeartScore) (Pearson correlation coefficient (R): 0.56, P ≤ 0.001) and increased in an ordinal fashion from ""low risk"" to ""medium risk"" to ""high risk"" to ""very high risk"" (pseudo R2 = 0.30; P < 0.001). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, SI was the best discriminator between low to medium risk and high-risk categories (area under curve (AUC): 0.76 (95% CI 0.64-0.88), P < 0.001) when compared to total cholesterol, plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio and had the utility to discriminate the individuals with known CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension.

Scopus,311,Clinical reliability and utility of skin perfusion pressure measurement in ischemic limbs-Comparison with other noninvasive diagnostic methods,"Purpose: We studied whether the measurement of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) is useful for evaluating ischemic limbs and predicting wound healing. Methods: Two hundred eleven patients (age range, 45 to 90 years; mean age, 69.6 ± 9.2 years; 170 men and 41 women), 403 limbs with arteriosclerosis obliterans, were included in this study. Half of the patients had diabetes or were receiving dialysis or both. Results: Significant correlations were found between SPP and ankle blood pressure (ABP), SPP and toe blood pressure (TBP), and SPP and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) (P < .0001, r = 0.75; P < .0001, r = 0.85; P < .0001, r = 0.62; respectively). In 94 limbs with ulcer or gangrene, wound healing was predicted by the SPP. The mean SPP (mean ± SD) in the healed-wound group (25 limbs, 48 ± 20 mm Hg) was greater than that in the unhealed-wound group (69 limbs, 23 ± 11 mm Hg) (P <.001). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the cut-off value of SPP was 40 mm Hg (sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 88%). Furthermore, we studied whether the combination of SPP and another measurement could predict wound healing more accurately than could any single variable. There was a strong correlation between SPP, TBP, and the healing rate (P < .001, r = 0.69) and healing could be accurately predicted if the SPP was greater than 40 mm Hg and if the TBP was greater than 30 mm Hg. Conclusions: Our results suggest that measurement of SPP is an objective method for assessing the severity of peripheral arterial disease or for predicting wound healing. © 2008 The Society for Vascular Surgery.",10.1016/j.jvs.2007.10.045,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,312,Independent determinants of second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram among various cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged men,"The second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) has been used as a non-invasive examination for arterial stiffness. The present study sought to elucidate independent determinants of the SDPTG among various cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Japanese men. The SDPTG was obtained from the cuticle of the left-hand forefinger in 973 male workers (mean age: 44±6 years) during a medical checkup at a company. The SDPTG indices (b/a and d/a) were calculated from the height of the wave components. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the independent determinants of an increased b/a (highest quartile of the b/a) were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.09-1.15), hypertension (OR: 1.65, 95% Cl: 1.03-2.65), dyslipidemia (OR: 1.51, 95% Cl: 1.09-2.09), impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.43, 95% Cl: 1.16-5.07), and a lack of regular exercise (OR: 2.00, 95% Cl: 1.29-3.08). Similarly, independent determinants of a decreased d/a (lowest quartile of the d/a) were age (OR: 1.11 per 1-year increase, 95% Cl: 1.08-1.14), hypertension (OR: 3.44, 95% Cl, 2.20-5.38), and alcohol intake 6 or 7 days per week (OR: 2.70, 95% Cl: 1.80-4.06). No independent association was observed between the SDPTG indices and blood leukocyte count or serum C-reactive protein levels. In conclusion, the SDPTG indices reflect arterial properties affected by several cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Japanese men.

Scopus,315,Assessment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis in hypertensive subjects: Second derivative of photoplethysmogram versus pulse wave velocity,"The pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the photoplethysmogram (PTG) are noninvasive methods for evaluating the pulse wave. The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and PWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complior device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 ± 4 m/sec v 12.4 ± 2 m/sec, P < .001), PTG AUI (0.322 ± 0.16 v 0.252 ± 0.09, P < .001), and SDPTG AI (- 0.093 ± 0.03 v -0.271 ± 0.018, P < .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients > 60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG AI by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives. (C) 2000 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.",10.1016/S0895-7061(99)00192-2,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,317,A computer based photoplethysmographic vascular analyzer through derivatives,"A computer based photoplethysmographic analyzer was developed. The signal was obtained by infrared light through the finger. It was converted into digital domain by a signal processing circuitry. First, second and fourth derivatives of the signal were computed. The acquisition and mathematical processing programs were implemented in object-oriented programming C. A study with 38 people, 19 healthy volunteers and 19 subjects with previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) was carried out. A t - tested distribution between healthy volunteers and patients showed a significant differences in calculated parameters. Photoplethysmographic augmentation index has shown to be a noninvasive parameter for vascular assessments.

Scopus,319,Laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes: The preliminary report,"Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become an epidemic health problem worldwide. Compared to Western countries, in Asia, T2DM occurs in patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) due to central obesity and decreased pancreatic β-cell function. The efficacy of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB) in obese patients with T2DM has been proven by numerous studies. Treatment outcomes of LMGB for non-obese T2DM patients are also estimated to be excellent. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LMBG in non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m2). Methods: Ten consecutive patients underwent LMGB at our hospital from August 2009 to October 2009. Preoperative data including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2 h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG) were compared with data collected at 1, 3, and 6 postoperative months. Results: All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Mean age of the patients was 46.9 years, mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m2, mean operative time was 150.5 min, and mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.3 days. Neither mortality nor major complications occurred. Mean preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level were 9.7%, 222 mg/dl, 343 mg/dl, and 2.78 ng/ml, respectively. At the sixth postoperative month, HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level measured 6.7%, 144 mg/dl, 203 mg/dl, and 2.18 ng/ml. Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated the resolution of hyperglycemia in 70% of non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m2). Although long-term follow-up data are required, early operative outcomes were satisfactory in terms of glycemic control and safety of the procedure. © 2010 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.",10.1007/s00268-010-0909-2,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,321,Non-invasive estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph by means of machine learning techniques,"Objective: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were RSBP2=0.91, RDBP2=0.89, and RBGL2=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7% of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B, and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.artmed.2011.05.001,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,322,Arterial stiffness using radial arterial waveforms measured at the wrist as an indicator of diabetic control in the elderly,"Although current technique of photoplethysmography (PPG) is a popular noninvasive method of waveform contour analysis in assessing arterial stiffness, data obtained are frequently affected by various environmental and physiological factors. We proposed an easily operable air pressure sensing system (APSS) for radial arterial signal capturing. Totally, 108 subjects (young, the aged with or without diabetes) were recruited from July 2009 to May 2010. Arterial waveform signals from the wrist were obtained and analyzed using HilbertHuang transformation (HHT). Through ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the signals were decomposed into eight intrinsic mode functions (IMF18) of which IMF5 was found to be the desired signal with a discernible diastolic peak. The results showed significant differences in reflection index (RI) and stiffness index (SI) from the young subjects and those from the aged participants with or without diabetes. Significant differences in RI and SI were also noted between subjects with well-controlled diabetes and those without. Good reproducibility and correlation were demonstrated. In conclusion, the present study proposed the application of radial arterial signal capturing subsystem and HHT in acquiring more reliable data on RI and SI compared with the conventional PPG method. © 2010 IEEE.",10.1109/TBME.2010.2084087,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,323,Autoregressive modeling of the photoplethysmogram AC signal amplitude changes after flow-mediated dilation in healthy and diabetic subjects,"It is proved that the endothelial (artery inner lumen cells) function is associated with cardiovascular risk factors. Among all the common non-invasive methods employed in the research setting for assessing endothelial function, flow-mediated dilation is the most widely used one. This technique measures endothelial function by inducing reactive hyperemia using temporary arterial occlusion and measuring the resultant relative increase in blood vessel diameter via ultrasound. In this paper, the limitations associated with the ultrasound technique are overcome by using the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal recorded during FMD. The correctness of this approach is investigated by modeling the AC changes of PPG after FMD by a 2nd order autoregressive model. A sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 81.6% and total accuracy of 80% were achieved in classification of 16 healthy and 14 diabetic subjects. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/ICBME.2012.6519679,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,324,Preliminary assessment of an automatic screening device for peripheral arterial disease using ankle-brachial and toe-brachial indices,"Background and objectives: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is currently recommended for the screening of peripheral arterial disease. However, this method becomes less reliable in the presence of calcified, incompressible arteries, as they result in an erroneously elevated ABI, and an additional measure termed the toe-brachial index (TBI) is recommended. The evaluation of ABI, and in particular TBI, typically requires significant technical skill and often involves referral to a vascular laboratory. This present situation reveals the need for a valid and reliable, automatic, noninvasive device that will provide both ABI and TBI at the level of the primary care physician. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of such a device, the Vasera VS-1500AT, in the assessment of toe, ankle, and brachial systolic blood pressures. Materials and methods: This study involved the assessment of 80 limbs from 40 normotensive and hypertensive individuals (17 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 45±18 years. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation (r=0.92) between toe systolic blood pressures obtained manually with photoplethysmography compared with those obtained through the automated device. The same significant correlation was also seen between the two with ankle (r=0.87) and brachial (r=0.88) systolic blood pressures. Conclusion: These strong correlations demonstrate that further investigation of this device is warranted regarding its use as a screening tool for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. The automation provided by this device could potentially eliminate variability in these measurements thereby allowing for screening and diagnosis to be done without referral to a vascular laboratory. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",10.1097/MBP.0b013e328346a839,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,325,Towards noninvasive monitoring of total hemoglobin concentration and fractional oxygen saturation based on earlobe pulse oximetry,"Till now, there is no available device which can measure the total hemoglobin (THb) concentration and the fractional oxygen saturation (SaO2) noninvasively. Finger, earlobe, nose bridge clamp and forehead sensors have been already used to monitor the functional oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin. Earlobe sensor has a lot of advantages that make it attractive for measuring the hemoglobin concentration and the SaO2. The structure of earlobe enables the application of the theoretical discipline with smaller errors. This may enable the calculation of other blood constituents like glucose. Less disturbance of the patient is achieved for monitoring. In cases of low perfusion, the pulse wave velocity will be affected and the time delay problem will be appeared. But the time delay for the earlobe sensor will be stay smaller than the finger sensor. For motion artifact effect in ambulance overcoming, an adaptive filter is used for reliable measurements. The effect of the motion artifact on the earlobe sensor will be also smaller than on the finger sensor. For long time monitoring and for home use the earlobe sensor consumes less power than the finger sensor. Available reformed light emitting diodes (LEDs) with different wavelengths and especially in the infrared region, where the light absorption of tissue is too high, can be applied by the earlobe clip. The noninvasive measurements are based on the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal which will be studied for the earlobe and the finger sensors under various conditions using Lambert Beer Law (LBL). The difficulties related to the calculations will be also discussed. The study reported that the earlobe sensor can be a suitable sensor under various conditions to calculate the THb concentration and SaO2. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/978-3-540-89208-3_414,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,326,Assessment of vasoactive agents and vascular aging by the second derivative of photoplethysmogram waveform,"To evaluate the clinical application of the second derivative of the fingertip photoplethysmogram waveform, we performed drug administration studies (study 1) and epidemiological studies (study 2). In study 1, scending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean±SD age of 54±11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 μg angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40±0.13 to -0.62±0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to - 0.25±0.12 (P<0.001 and P<O.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P<0.001, and r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P<0.001, y=0.023x-l.515). The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06±0.36 versus -0.22±0.41, P<0.01). Women had a higher aging index than men (P<0.01). The b-c-d-e/a ratio may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging and for screening of arteriosclerotic disease.",10.1161/01.HYP.32.2.365,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,328,Noninvasive assessment of endothelial activity in patients with peripheral arterial disease and cardiovascular risk factors,"Microvascular endothelial activity (EA) after stimulation with iontophoretically administered acetylcholine was evaluated using laser Doppler fluxmetery (LDF) and calibrated photoplethysmography (c-PPG) in normal patients and patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patients included 79 non-PAD subjects and 51 patients with PAD. Upper and lower extremity EA was examined using LDF and c-PPG after acetylcholine iontophoresis for 10 min. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed using integrated area under response curve. In non-PAD patients, the EA by LDF in the upper extremity was significantly lower in the older patients compared to the younger patients. Conversely, EA by LDF detected no significant difference between these groups in the lower extremity.With c-PPG, the EA was slightly reduced in the upper but not in the lower extremity in older patients. Comparing PAD patients to the older patients, there was a significantly lower EA response in the upper and lower extremities by LDF. Likewise, c-PPG detected a highly significantly reduced EA in the upper and lower extremities for PAD patients. These results indicated that using a noninvasive technique to determine EA, there were significant differences in the EA response to acetylcholine between those with PAD and normal patients over the age of 50. Importantly, the EA response was reduced in the upper and lower extremities, indicating systemic disease of the endothelium in PAD patients.",10.1080/10623320701547158,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,332,Influence of autologous arteriovenous fistula on the blood supply to the hand in very elderly hemodialyzed patients,"Introduction: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation for hemodialysis (HD) could predispose to local arterial insufficiency of the hand (steal syndrome). Patients with diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease and elderly patients tend to have a higher risk of hand ischemia. Purpose and methods: To estimate the influence of AVF on the blood supply to the hands in the elderly population and to identify steal syndrome cases by non-invasive diagnostics (finger photoplethysmography (PPG), pulse volume recording (PVR), Doppler analysis and pulseoxymetry). The evaluation was carried out in 25 random patients (10 females, 15 males) >75 yrs of age (79.6 ± 3.87 yrs), whose functioning autotogous AVFs had been placed at least 1 month previously. Results: Mean PPG and PVR amplitudes did not differ in statistical analysis (p > 0.05) between hands with and without an AVF. One patient (4%) with end-to-side anastomosis was diagnosed with steal syndrome (typical manifestation confirmed in PPG, Doppler and pulseoxymetry). Two other patients with high brachio-cephalic anastomosis presented subclinical steal syndrome (only low PPG and PVR). Conclusions: Even in the very elderly, AVF creation should be considered due to a lesser influence on the blood supply to the hands. Non-invasive diagnostics used by us seemed to be useful in identifying steal syndrome after AVF creation. © Wichtig Editore, 2005.",10.1177/112972980500600207,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,334,Optical techniques in the assessment of peripheral arterial disease,"A variety of optical techniques have been developed over the years for experimental use in vascular disease, mainly for the assessment of lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Optical techniques have several advantages over more traditional experimental approaches. Photoplethysmograph (PPG) was one of the earliest methods used for this purpose; PPG satisfies many of the conditions for a non-invasive technique to estimate skin blood flow using infrared light, not only for research but also in clinical practice. PPG is a promising, safe and easy-to-use tool for diagnosis and early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be useful for regular GP-assessment or even self-monitoring of PAD at home or during individual physical exercises.

Scopus,335,Responses of the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram indices and hemodynamic parameters to anesthesia induction,"The finger photoplethysmogram (PTG) is a non-invasive method for pulse-wave analysis. The second derivative wave of the PTG (SDPTG) enables evaluation of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular aging. Responses of SDPTG indices and hemodynamic parameters to anesthesia induction are unknown. A total of 42 patients aged ≥40 years, who may have had atherosclerotic change, and who underwent elective oral surgery, were analyzed. Patients were divided into sevoflurane (S group; N=22) and sevoflurane with remifentanil (R group; N=20) groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and SDPTG were measured at four time points: before induction, after loss of consciousness, after tracheal intubation and 30 min after induction. At postintubation, b/a was elevated (that is, large arterial stiffness was increased), and d/a was reduced (that is, peripheral vascular resistance was increased) in the S group compared with the R group. SBP, DBP and HR were increased in the S group compared with those in the R group. In the S group, preanesthetic b/a and the aging index (AGI) were positively correlated with SBP at immediate postintubation, and preanesthetic d/a was negatively correlated with SBP and DBP at immediate postintubation. It is suggested that usage of remifentanil, a potent μ-opioid analgesic, with sevoflurane anesthesia prevented an increase in blood pressure and HR in response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, which was accompanied by suppression of both elevation of b/a and the AGI and reduction of d/a. SDPTG indices are useful for predicting hypertension during induction of sevoflurane anesthesia, regardless of a history of hypertension or hypertensive factors. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.",10.1038/hr.2011.152,YES,Unique DOI
Scopus,336,Oxidative stress could precede endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians with impaired glucose metabolism,"Aims/hypothesis. To measure oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians at different stages of development of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. Plasma total 8-epi-PGF2α, an indicator of oxidative stress, was determined in age-matched subjects with normal glucose metabolism (n = 39), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 14), newly diagnosed diabetes (n = 8) and established diabetes (n = 14). Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at base-line and 2 h following an oral glucose tolerance test. Endothelial function was assessed by non-invasive digital pulse wave photoplethysmography. Results. Plasma 8-epi-PGF2α increased in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) compared with control subjects, and was even higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.01) diabetic patients. A tendency towards reduced endothelial function in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance became significant in patients with newly diagnosed and established diabetes (p < 0.01), and was correlated with 8-epi-PGF2α (r=0.36, p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) did not change in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with control subjects, but increased in newly diagnosed (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.001) diabetic subjects. The 8-epi-PGF2α was correlated with fasting glucose (r = 0.50, p < 0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Conclusion/interpretation.

Scopus,338,Design and development of non invasive glucose measurement system,"One of the biggest health challenges of 21 st century is diabetics due to its exponential increase in the diabetics patients in the age group of 20-79 years. To prevent the complication due to diabetics it is essential to monitor the blood glucose level continuously. Most of the regular glucose measurement systems are invasive in nature. Invasive methods cause pain, time consumption, high cost and potential risk of spreading infection diseases. Therefore there is a great demand to have reliable cost effective and comfortable non invasive system for the detection of blood glucose level continuously. The proposed method is based on the direct effect of glucose on the scattering properties of the organ. Glucose decreases the mismatch in refractive index between scatterers and their surrounding media, leading to a smaller scattering coefficient and, consequently, a shorter optical path. The reduction in scattering is due to an increase in glucose concentration. As a result, with the growing concentration of glucose, fewer photons are absorbed and the light intensity increases. In the present work, we have used PPG technique. An algorithm was developed from the PPG data for monitoring blood glucose. The result obtained from this technique was compared with ARKRAY, Glucocard tm01-mini and found good agreement. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/ISPTS.2012.6260873,YES,Unique DOI

Scopus,182,Pulse Signal Preprocessing Based on Wavelet Transform-Principal Component Analysis,"One of the key indicators for monitoring human health is the pulse signal produced by the human body, which can reflect a wide range of physiological data. Photoplethysmography (PPG) can realize non-invasive and continuous monitoring of pulse wave signal, but it is susceptible to interference from human EMG signal, power frequency interference, baseline drift and other noises, resulting in inaccurate signals. Wavelet transform and principal component analysis (PCA) are used to get rid of baseline drift and high frequency noise in pulse wave signals, thereby reducing noise interference. It is possible to obtain an accurate pulse wave signal by preprocessing the actual data that the sensor has collected. The findings indicate that the algorithm can effectively remove noise, preserve the main details of the signal, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, provide effective data support for more accurate estimation of human physiological parameters including heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as well as enable the combination of medical signal monitoring and smart wearable devices. © Textile Bioengineering and Informatics Symposium Proceedings 2022 - 15th Textile Bioengineering and Informatics Symposium, TBIS 2022.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)

Scopus,218,The utility and pitfalls of the currently used measures of glycaemia in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus,"HbA1c and glycaemic variability are two major components of diabetic dysglycaemia. HbAIc, which is the integrated effect of FPG, and PPG, represents the chronic sustained hyperglycaemia and is the long-term glycaemic measure of diabetes control and patient’s risk for its complications. Glycaemic variability represents acute glycaemic fluctuations and is associated with activation of oxidative stress with resultant overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain. Self-monitoring of blood glucose with an optimal frequency of 3 - 7 per day is the cornerstone of diabetes management and is associated with significantly improved glycaemic control and decreased all cause and diabetes-related mortality in insulin treated diabetics. SMBG and HbA1C supplemented with RT-CGM have been shown to improve glycaemic control and glycaemic excursions. Use of continous glucose monitoring systems which provide a more complete view of the glycaemic excursions, has been validated in T1DM but not in T2DM. The use of RT-CGM as sole glycaemic measure; however, is not recommended in the ICU and the operating room settings because of uncoupling of relationship between plasma glucose and ISF due to altered haemodynamics and interference from the use of vasopressors and other medications in such settings. 1, 5-anhydroglucitol, fructosamine and glycated albumin are useful short-term measures of glycaemic control over the preceding 2 - 3 weeks in conditions like haemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, haemolytic anaemias, CKD, etc., which affect the glycation of intracellularly located haemoglobin. 1,5 anhydrogluctitol is a useful marker of post-prandial glycaemic fluctuations in patients with HbA1C at or near target. Role of glycaemic variability in the onset and progression of diabetic complications, and that of 1, 5 anhydrogluctotol in non-Japanese ethnic groups and in condition with severe hyperglycaemia (HbA1C > 10%) needs to be evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. The concern raised by FDA regarding accuracy of SMBG devices using glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase, for measuring glucose need to addressed. Though GV is perceived as newer component of dysglycaemic risk yet its role in assessing the patient’s risk for complications needs further validation before its routine clinical use as an additional or alternative glycaemic measures can be considered. This article attempts to assess the utility and pitfalls of these currently used measures of glycaemia in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. © 2015, Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine.

Scopus,220,Effect of source wavelength on second derivative of finger photoplethysmogram in healthy young female volunteers,"Background: Non-invasive methods for screening and diagnosis are the field with fast growing interest which leads to various biological signal measurements like Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and pressure pulse. PPG monitoring is widely used in the healthcare as this single pulse study can provide wide physiological information non-invasively such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure (continuous and cuff less), blood volume, arterial stiffness and respiration rate. First and second derivatives of PPG provide important information about the arterial stiffness and vascular health of the person. Aim: This paper explains the design and development of prototype with RED LED (660 nm) and IR LED (860 nm) as a source and OPT 101 as a detector. Second derivative related indices of PPG (for RED LED and IR LED) were calculated. Materials and methods: Study was carried out on 15 healthy female subjects without any known history of blood pressure and blood glucose; aged between 19-23 years. Results and conclusion: Amplitude of PPG obtained from RED LED is smaller than the amplitude of PPG obtained from IR LED. Comparative analysis of first and second derivative of the PPG obtained from RED light source and IR light source is discussed by the authors. It was observed that various parameters studied from second derivative are the ‘Normalized Values’, so effect of change in the amplitude of the PPG signal obtained from RED LED and IR LED get nullified in this study (P>0.05). Though IR source based reflective type of sensor related study can be useful in future for the brain vascular health assessment. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India.

Scopus,232,Simulation of photoplethysmographic glucometer,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic systemic metabolic problem and many people in this world are suffering from with this disease. Diabetes can lead to severe complications over time, including blindness, kidney failure, heart failure, and peripheral neuropathy associated with limb pain, poor circulation, gangrene and subsequent amputation. It is necessary to control this disease by regular monitoring of blood glucose and the appropriate adjustment in the dose of medicine. Regular monitoring can be done either with the help of Pathology laboratories or by the patient himself with the help of hand held instrument such as ""Accu-Chek"" or ""Advance Microdraw"". Either of these methods necessitates a finger puncture, sometimes several times a day, to obtain a droplet of blood for chemical analysis. It is needless to say that this procedure, being invasive, is inconvenient and unpleasant for diabetic subject and often leads to poor patient compliance. A solution can be provided to this problem by developing a non-invasive method to assess the blood glucose using the principle of Photo Plethysmography.

Scopus,238,Endothelial dysfunction assessed by photoplethysmography in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2; [Disfunción endotelial evaluada a través de fotopletismografía en pacientes con diabetes mellitus tipo 2],"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) reduces life expectancy by a third, principally because of cardiovascular disease and endothelial dysfunction are considered the first manifestations of vascular disease. Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive technique to evaluate endothelial dysfunction based on the emission of infra-red light on the skin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate endothelial function by photoplethysmography in patients with type 2 DM without evidence of vascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study of patients with and without DM was undertaken. Endothelial function was evaluated using photoplethysmographic waves taking into consideration the shape of the curve and time of maximum amplitude/total time of the curve (TMA/TT) before and after ischemia induced by arterial obstruction. RESULTS: In 174 subjects included, a greater basal TMA/TT index was found in diabetics, even after adjusting for age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism. The percentage of change in amplitude post-ischemia compared to basal value was diminished in diabetics (p=0.030). Persons with diabetes, with and without endothelial dysfunction, had comparable HbA1c concentrations; but diabetics with endothelial dysfunction had lower serum concentration of HDL-C (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: More endothelial dysfunction was found in patients with diabetes. While the control of diabetes did not influence endothelial dysfunction, it was associated with lower HDL cholesterol.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)

Scopus,273,Non-invasive blood glucose measurement scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy,"Diabetes is a kind of common chronic diseases, seriously harmful to human health. Determination of blood glucose levels is the key link in diabetes care. The traditional measurement method firstly collects blood drops, and then uses the blood analyzer for electrochemical analysis. The traditional method is inconvenient, algesiogenic and easily cause infection. With the development of chemometric methods, infrared spectroscopy has been widely used in the field of blood glucose measurement and medicine care. The non-invasive blood glucose measurement scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy is a way which is more efficiently, without damage and chemical reagents. In this paper, we proposed a non-invasive blood glucose detection and analysis the scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy. In order to avoid the influence of the environment during the measuring process and considering the individual differences, we use the wave acquisition system to collect human pulse wave, and reduce the noise of the pulse wave signal first. By comparing the actual measured data with the data obtained in the traditional way, we can establish models to predict the blood glucose levels and achieve non-invasive blood glucose measurement using spectrum analysis technology. In the end, we improve the models by analyzing the relationship between individual factors and the pulse wave signal. The experimental results show that the method can effectively determine the blood glucose levels, and it is more convenient, safer and healthier than the traditional method, which can effectively reduce the time cost and the money cost. © 2018 Optics InfoBase Conference Papers.

Scopus,302,Measuring toe pressures using a portable photoplethysmograph to detect arterial disease in high-risk patients: An overview of the literature,"Lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) is estimated to affect one third of individuals older than 65 years of age, occurs in younger individuals who use tobacco or have diabetes mellitus (DM), and often remains undiagnosed until a patient pres- ents with ischemia-related symptoms or complications. Valid and reliable noninvasive tests such as the ankle-brachial index (ABI) are recommended to detect LEAD. However, ABI results can be inconclusive or the index can be elevated (ie, <1.3) in persons with calcified ankle arteries due to DM, renal failure, or arthritis. In these instances, obtaining toe pressure (TP) measurements, which correlate well with angiographic findings, is advised, providing the patient does not have vasoconstriction with cold toes or vasospastic disease. In such cases, TP can be obtained using a portable pho- toplethysmograph (PPG), which offers a simple and inexpensive method for healthcare providers in a variety of clinical settings to assess for the presence of LEAD. Portable PPG TP measurements have been found to have a high level of agreement with vascular laboratory PPG tests to detect LEAD, as well as good sensitivity and a high specificity. Adopting a TP measurement protocol of care to assess high-risk individuals such as patients with DM and elevated ABIs potentially can have a major impact on early identification of LEAD and reduce the risk of ischemia-related complications, including lower extremity wounds and amputations.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)

Scopus,310,Serical changes of pulse wave velocity and correlation with hemodynamic parameters during general anesthesia,"Background: Increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a marker of increased arterial stiffness and is correlated with cardiovascular mortality and mortality of all causes in the elderly and in patients with essential hypertension and type 2 diabetes. There is also a positive correlation between PWV and arterial blood pressure. The changes of PWV in response to general anesthesia and surgical stimulation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to continuously monitor the PWV, blood pressure and heart rate, and to assess their correlations during general anesthesia in women receiving gynecologic surgery. Methods: The values of PWV were obtained from calculation of the finger-to-toe distance divided by the transit time using dual-channel photoplethysmography system. The values of PWV, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia induction, 5 min before incision, at incision, in continuation for at least 30 min thereafter, and 5 min after discontinuation of sevoflurane. The correlations between PWV and SBP, DBP and heart rate during the general anesthesia were analyzed using Pearson's correlation test. Results: The serial records of PWV and hemodynamic parameters showed that PWV, SBP, DBP, and heart rate decreased after induction of anesthesia. SBP and DBP increased after surgical incision. There was a trend of progressively declining of PWV and DBP during the general anesthesia but SBP and heart rate remained stationary. All the values of PWV, SBP, DBP, and heart rate increased after discontinuation of anesthesia. There were significant correlations between PWV and SBP (r = 0.4558, P < 0.0001), between PWV and DBP (r = 0.2719, P < 0.0001), between PWV and pulse pressure (r = 0.2067, P < 0.0001), and between PWV and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.3969, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: We could evaluate the serial changes of PWV in response to general anesthesia and surgical stimulation using a simple and noninvasive dual-channel photoplethysmography system.

Doppler ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is considered the non-invasive screening test of choice to detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Photoplethysmography (PPG) and pulse oximetry (PO) are also suitable alternatives; however, correlation and validation are yet to be established. We compare Doppler ABI, PPG-derived and PO-derived indices to detect PAD. Design. Prospective case control study. Methods. Forty-six subjects were evaluated by PO, PPG, and Doppler ABI. Twenty-three patients had known PAD and 24 were healthy subjects with no signs of PAD. Pressure in arms, fingers, toes, and ankles were measured, and different pressure indices calculated. Results. Groups of control participants and patients with peripheral vascular disease were significantly different with regards to age, prevalence of diabetes, and prevalence of hypertension. Doppler ABI was most sensitive (81.4%) to diagnose PAD in the main study group (n ≤ 46). In patients with diabetes and/or chronic renal failure, Doppler ABI had lower sensitivity (69.2-71.4%) and was comparable to the other diagnostic tests; photoplethysmography toe-finger index (TFI) achieved the highest sensitivity in these patients. (84.6-85.7%). Conclusions. Doppler ABI had the highest sensitivity to diagnose PAD overall. In patients with diabetes and/or chronic renal failure, Doppler ABI had lower sensitivity and was comparable to most of the other diagnostic tests.

IEEE,2,Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Using a Photo Detector-Based Approach: A Promising Alternative for Diabetes Management,"Diabetes mellitus usually known as diabetes has been an active issue for a long period. Monitoring of Blood glucose levels is one of the important physiological information for medical professionals. Non-invasive detection of blood glucose levels is necessary for monitoring and managing diabetes and reducing the need for frequent finger pricks as invasive methods. Non-invasive measurement of blood glucose provides a convenient and pain-free alternative to traditional invasive methods. The traditional methods require pricking of the finger for taking blood samples and calibration for proper results. Non-calibrated devices can lead to faulty results. In this study, a photo detector-based approach is used to measure the blood glucose level. The system is based on a photodetector sensor that detects the changes in light absorption caused by variations in blood glucose levels. In this study, we performed experiments on two sets of groups, one with normal and the other with fasting state to compare the invasive and non-invasive values of glucose in different subjects to make a standard non-invasive glucometer system. The evaluation was conducted on a group of participants before and after the ingestion of glucose during the procedure. The sensor was placed superficially on the fingertip to acquire the photoplethysmography signal along with the traditional measurement method for reference blood glucose values. The MATLAB-based algorithm has been designed to further filter and process the signal and measure the blood glucose level. The results indicate a strong correlation between photoplethysmography detector-based measurement and the reference blood glucose levels. The non-invasive method exhibited promising accuracy and reliability in estimating blood glucose concentrations. The proposed approach provides a non-invasive measurement of blood glucose level which improves the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.",10.1109/IBCAST59916.2023.10712978,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/ibcast59916.2023.10712978)

IEEE,13,Design and development of non invasive glucose measurement system,"One of the biggest health challenges of 21st century is diabetics due to its exponential increase in the diabetics patients in the age group of 20–79 years. To prevent the complication due to diabetics it is essential to monitor the blood glucose level continuously. Most of the regular glucose measurement systems are invasive in nature. Invasive methods cause pain, time consumption, high cost and potential risk of spreading infection diseases. Therefore there is a great demand to have reliable cost effective and comfortable non invasive system for the detection of blood glucose level continuously. The proposed method is based on the direct effect of glucose on the scattering properties of the organ. Glucose decreases the mismatch in refractive index between scatterers and their surrounding media, leading to a smaller scattering coefficient and, consequently, a shorter optical path. The reduction in scattering is due to an increase in glucose concentration. As a result, with the growing concentration of glucose, fewer photons are absorbed and the light intensity increases. In the present work, we have used PPG technique. An algorithm was developed from the PPG data for monitoring blood glucose.

People with diabetes need regular checks of their blood glucose levels to keep track of them and maintain them in healthy ranges. These regular checks are expensive in terms of the consumables being used to perform the tests, i.e., test strips and prick needles, as they are changed every time a test is conducted. Also, the discomfort and pain during the sample collection and the risk of getting an infection are high.

The 940 nm wavelength has been found to be more accurate at detecting glucose levels. Employing near-infrared spectroscopy, the light passes through the skin which interacts with the chemical constituents of the illuminated tissue to partially absorb and disperse the light.

IEEE,41,Multi-models with averaging in feature domain for non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"Diabetes is a serious chronic metabolic disease. In the recent years, more and more studies focus on the use of the non-invasive methods to achieve the blood glucose estimation. More and more consumer technology enterprises focusing on human health are committed to implementing accurate and non-invasive blood glucose algorithm in their products. The near infrared spectroscopy built in the wearable devices is one of the common approaches to achieve the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. However, due to the interference from the external environment, these wearable non-invasive methods yield the low estimation accuracy. Even if it is not medical equipment, as a consumer product, the detection accuracy will also be an important indicator for consumers. To address this issue, this paper employs different models based on different ranges of the blood glucose values for performing the blood glucose estimation. First the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are acquired and they are denoised via the bit plane singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Second, the features are extracted. For the data in the training set, first the features are averaged across the measurements in the feature domain via the optimization approach. Second, the random forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the training set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood glucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose values in the same group are employed to build an individual model. Fifth, for each feature, the average of the feature values for all the measurements in the same subset is computed. For the data in the test set, first, the sum of the weighted distances between the test feature values and the average values obtained in the above is computed for each model. Here, the weights are defined based on the importance sorted by the random forest obtained in the above. The model corresponding to the smallest sum is assigned. Finally, the blood glucose value is estimated based on the corresponding model. Compared to the state of arts methods, our proposed method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy.

The long term diabetes increases the risk of the stroke, the heart diseases, the kidney damage and the blindness. Therefore, the blood glucose estimation is crucial for the diabetic patients. The photoplethesmograms (PPGs) can be used for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation.

In this experiment, the synchronous principal weight amplitude ratio sequences and RRI sequences of healthy subjects (Group 1: 30 people) and diabetic subjects (Group 2: 28 people) were extracted, and the anastomoses between them were calculated using PEn. The normal physiological parameters of the human body and PEn were tested using an independent-sample T-test and Pearson correlation analysis.

IEEE,130,Model for Glycemic Level Detection using Heart Rate Variability in a Mexican Sample,"Background: Type I and II diabetic patients must measure their glucose levels up to 10 times a day. The most common way is through an invasive blood test that causes pain, fear, discomfort and an important economic impact. Recent studies have shown a correlation between heart rate variability (HRV) and glucose levels, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. This research aimed at designing a machine learning algorithm for glucose level detection using HRV features. Methods: We acquired physiological and clinical data from 5, yielding 100 observations. Then, we detected peaks from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and evaluated the peak detection accuracy. Afterwards, we measured multiple HRV-related features from such peaks. Then, data was curated, and relevant features were selected. After that, hyperparameters were optimized for 5 different estimators, and such values were used to create and evaluate predictive models. Results: The PPG peak detection algorithm performed efficiently, with an above 99% precision. The feature selection process yielded 20 features, 65% of them were HRV-related. The best model for glucose level detection was an ensemble between a Support Vector Machine, a Lasso and an Elasticnet model, with a mean absolute error of 16.24 mg/dL. Discussion: HRV features were very important to detect glucose levels. But fatigue, blood pressure and BMI were also included in the final model. We were limited by the size of the dataset, but our results are promising and HRV should be further explored as an indirect way of measuring blood glucose concentration. Additionally, and unlike similar studies in which HRV was measured from medical-grade electrocardiogram equipment, we measured HRV features from a PPG signal obtained using a commercial pulse oximeter. This would allow not only for a non-invasive glucose level measuring, but for it to be performed in a non-clinical setting.",10.1109/IECBES48179.2021.9398841,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/iecbes48179.2021.9398841)

The risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, sedentary lifestyle and smoking. Many parameters had been produced to monitor cardiovascular disease risk. Finger photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple, low-cost and non-invasive optical method that detects blood volume change in the microvascular bed of the finger.

IEEE,140,Association of Severe Stenosis in Coronary Arteries with Common Demographic and Clinical Data among Ischemic Heart Disease Patients,"The number of death due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) keep increasing every year and it is usually caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). Early diagnosis of CAD requires a combination of multiple tests including a 12-lead ECG test, blood test, and stress test before the patient can go through a more complex procedure such as coronary computed tomography angiography or invasive coronary angiography procedure. The study aims to investigate the association between common parameters from the preliminary test of CAD to the severity of stenosis in the coronary arteries among newly diagnosed IHD patients. A total of 80 CAD patients (55 ± 9.52 years) have participated in this study and their demographic data, vital signs, blood tests, as well as ECG result are taken just before they are going for the angiography procedure. It was found that 75% of the subjects are overweight. The results also showed that the number of patients who smoke, have diabetes, and have hypertension is higher in the case group (stenosis ≥ 70%) as compared to the control group (stenosis < 70%). There was no clinical data that can differentiate severe stenosis in the coronary arteries, except for fasting blood sugar (p=0.002). Subjects with severely blocked arteries tend to have higher levels of blood sugar with a mean of 8.05 ± 3.60. Framingham risk scores (FRS) for both groups were also compared, and it is found that 59% of the total subjects have low FRS, even though half of them have severe stenosis.

IEEE,148,28.3 A 28μW 134dB DR 2nd-Order Noise-Shaping Slope Light-to-Digital Converter for Chest PPG Monitoring,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a key non-invasive technique to extract vital signs like heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Integrated in smartwatches, health patches and finger clips, PPG sensors are widely used in fitness, glucose, blood pressure, and medical monitoring with good user comfort. Integrating PPG in medical chest patches is interesting for COVID-19 patients since it can yield, next to HR and respiration, also SpO2, which traditional ECG-based patches cannot provide. However, measuring PPG/SpO2 on the chest is challenging due to large motion artifacts, small AC/DC perfusion index (PI $\lt 0.1$%), and ambient light. Therefore, it poses a more stringent requirement on dynamic range (DR $\gt 120$ dB) for the PPG readout circuit, while still requiring low power consumption for long battery life. On-chip pinned-photodiodes (PPDs) have been used as passive integrators, resulting in very low power consumption $(2.63 \mu \mathrm{W})$ for the PPG readout [1]. However, the DR and linearity can be limited by the PPDs’ parasitic capacitors. Direct light-to-digital converter (LDC) topologies are proposed in [2 - 4], but their DR is still below 120dB. In [5], a digital-controlled TIA is exploited to control the transimpedance gain, which extends the DR to 130dB while consuming $72 \mu \mathrm{W}$ in the analog front-end (AFE).",10.1109/ISSCC42613.2021.9365757,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/isscc42613.2021.9365757)

IEEE,153,Estimation of Blood Pressure and Pulse Transit Time Using Your Smartphone,"It is widely recognized today that there is an alarming rise of lifestyle-induced chronic diseases (e.g., type II diabetes) in our society. Therefore, a strong need exists for cost-effective and non-invasive devices that can measure blood pressure (BP) to monitor, diagnose and follow-up patients at risk, but also healthy population in general. One promising method for arterial BP estimation is to measure a surrogate marker of it, such as, Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and derive pressure values from it. However, current methods for measuring PTT require complex sensing and analysis circuitry and the related medical devices are expensive and inconvenient for the user to wear. In this paper, we present a new smartphone-based method to estimate PTT reliably and subsequently BP from the baseline sensors on smartphones. This new approach involves determining PTT by simultaneously measuring the time the blood leaves the heart, by recording the heart sound using the standard microphone of the phone and the time it reaches the finger, by measuring the pulse wave using the phone's camera. Moreover, we also describe algorithms that can be executed directly on current smartphones to obtain clean and robust heart sound signals and to extract the pulse wave characteristics using smartphones. We also present methods to ensure a synchronous capture of the waveforms, which is essential to obtain reliable PTT values with inexpensive sensors.

One of the approaches is to monitor the health state of the patient and screen it to doctors or paramedical staff through the IoT, as it is hard to screen the patient for 24 hours. So here the patient health condition or status i.e. Pulse rate, Respiratory rate, Body Temperature, Position of the body, Blood glucose, ECG and so on can be measured by utilizing the Non-invasive sensors. These sensors are associated with the Arduino Uno board, it gathers the information i.e. biomedical data from the sensors and the detected biomedical information can be transmitted to the server. The “Thingspeak” named new cloud is utilized here to place the detected information into the server. From this server the information can be envisioned to the specialists and other paramedical staff by Thingspeak android app. In this way by utilizing this Smart health monitoring system diminishes the exertion of specialists and paramedical staffs to screen the patient for 24 hours and furthermore lessens the time and cost of support.",10.1109/I-SMAC.2017.8058240,YES,Unique DOI
IEEE,156,"Acquisition and Identification of Vata, Pitta and Kapha of an individual","With the ever-increasing number of diseases in today's world, there is a need for a system to provide early diagnosis and the root cause of human health. Indian and Chinese traditional medicine system provides natural and simple solutions to detecting health issues. Nadi-Nidan is an ancient medical technique, traced back to ancient Indian traditional health monitoring, known to indicate all the health features of a human body. In Nadi Nidan, Wrist pulses or arterial pulses are sensed to diagnose the health status. The study was carried out to design a non-invasive system for wrist pulse analysis that gives us the heartbeat, IBI (Inter-Beat-Interference) and the body type, to support doctors in routine diagnostic procedures and provide detailed procedure for obtaining the complete set of the Nadi signals as a time series. An Ayurveda practitioners and physicians can use this prototype for pulse reading and uniformate in analysis. The proposed model specifically deals with data acquisition of three Nadi signals Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Signals are obtained by using PPG sensors. Arduino is used as the data acquisition hardware. Identification of Prakruthi of the subject was carried out based on the amplitude of Vata, Pitta and Kapha signal acquired at the wrist and achieved 83% accurarcy. Vata, Pitta and Kapha of diabetic and normal subject were analyzed.",10.1109/CCIP57447.2022.10058666,YES,Unique DOI
IEEE,157,CMOS Transimpedance Amplifiers for Biomedical Applications: A Comparative Study,"Recently, different medical devices have emerged and utilized in a numerous health care fields such as pulse oximetry, cuffless blood pressure using Photoplethysmogram (PPG), noninvasive blood glucose measuring, and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Those devices are very similar in their analog front end circuit which is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). Many different TIA topologies have appeared in different optoelectronic fields which make the choice of the best TIA topology for a certain application a challenging task. In this regard, this paper presents a comparison between state of the art, previously published TIA topologies. All topologies are simulated at four different simulation cases to account for various design scenarios. The topologies are simulated with 10 pF photodiode (PD) input capacitance and 5 KHz bandwidth (BW) while optimizing for two different targets; one time for minimum input noise and the other for minimum power consumption. Moreover, the same procedures are performed with 2 pF PD and 100 MHz BW to account for higher BW demanding applications. The studied topologies are compared according to their transimpedance gain, power consumption, total input referred noise current, and dynamic range (DR) to expose their relative merits. A noise and a transimpedance gain mathematical models are also presented for each topology to assist the comparison. Recommendations to designers on which TIA to select in a certain application are concluded according to the obtained results.",10.1109/MCAS.2019.2961724,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/mcas.2019.2961724)
IEEE,71,Non-invasive blood glucose detection using NIR based on GA and SVR,"Between the human blood glucose with photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, there is a nonlinear and complex relation. For the purpose of measuring the human blood glucose level (BGL) from PPG signal, in this paper, we propose one non-invasive blood glucose detection method using NIR based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). During data preprocessing, we use the wavelet transform algorithm to smooth the PPG signal and eliminate baseline drift. 23-dimensional parameters, including some physiological and environmental parameters and features calculated from PPG signal, compose the feature matrix. Genetic Algorithm is used for feature selection. Selected parameters are used for SVR model training. On the test set, we used the method based on GA and SVR to obtain a 95.05% correlation coefficient, 1.74% higher than the method using SVR only.",,NO,Duplicate Title (already seen: non-invasive blood glucose detection using nir bas...)

WOS,1,A Noninvasive Blood Glucose Estimation System Using Dual-Channel PPGs and Pulse-Arrival Velocity,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that requires individuals with diabetes to perform finger stick blood sugar tests multiple times a day. This invasive method is not capable of continuously monitoring a diabetic patient's blood glucose levels and can be painful and inconvenient in the long term. In our study, we developed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation method using dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with pulse arrival velocity (PAV). The dual-channel PPG was chosen based on the advantages of 530 nm PPG in blood flow measurement and 1550 nm infrared light in blood glucose concentration detection. In addition to testing various amplitude features in PPG at different fiducial points (systolic peak, dicrotic notch, and diastolic peak), we also examined the amplitude ratio between the two PPG channels (530 nm green-light PPG and 1550 nm infrared PPG), as well as PAV, for noninvasive blood glucose estimation. In this study, we recruited 18 healthy subjects (14 males and four females; aged 29.4 +/- 7.87 years old). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) experiment was conducted on each participant to manipulate the blood glucose level. Each parameter for blood glucose estimation was examined using partial F-test to assess its impact on blood glucose estimation. We found that combining the amplitude ratio of the dual-channel PPG with PAV resulted in the best blood glucose estimation results, with estimation results falling within Zone A in the Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) with a 100% success rate, and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 7.46 +/- 2.43 mg/dL.",10.1109/JSEN.2023.3306343,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/jsen.2023.3306343)

Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR).

However, the pain sensation due to finger pricking is not only an inconvenience to patients, but can also reduce compliance with diabetes management. A reliable, mobile, easy-to-use, and noninvasive glucometer can address this problem. Noninvasive optical signals, such as those used to obtain a photoplethysmogram (PPG), have recently been used to measure human physiological and vascular conditions and have been adopted to estimate glucose. In this study, we conducted a clinical trial to acquire the PPG signals using wearable devices from nine type 2 diabetic patients. The global and personalized models were built using random forest and adaboost regression models.

The conventional finger-prick method, though accurate, is not feasible for use multiple times a day, as it is painful and test strips are expensive. Although minimally invasive and noninvasive CGM systems have been introduced into the market, they are expensive and require finger-prick calibrations. As the diabetes trend is high in low- and middle-income countries, a cost-effective and easy-to-use noninvasive glucose monitoring device is the need of the hour. This review paper briefly discusses the noninvasive glucose measuring technologies and their related research work. The technologies discussed are optical, transdermal, and enzymatic.

WOS,5,Design and Validation of a Monte Carlo Method for the Implementation of Noninvasive Wearable Devices for HbA1c Estimation Considering the Skin Effect,"To diagnose diabetes early or to maintain stable blood glucose levels in diabetics, blood glucose levels should be frequently checked. However, the only way to check blood glucose levels regularly is to use invasive methods, such as pricking the fingertip or using a minimally invasive patch. These invasive methods pose several problems, including being painful and potentially causing secondary infections. This study focuses on noninvasively measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using PPG signals. In particular, the study relates to a method and a hardware design technology for removing noise that may be present in a PPG signal due to skin contact with a noninvasive HbA1c measurement device. The proposed HbA1c measurement device consists of the first sensor (PPG sensor) module including an optical barrier and the second sensor (cylindrical sensor) module for removing the skin effect. We have developed a Monte Carlo method to implement accurate, noninvasive HbA1c measurement by considering different skin properties among different subjects. Implementing this model in wearable devices will allow end users to not only monitor their glycated hemoglobin levels but also control diabetes with higher accuracy without needing any blood samples.

Traditional invasive methods for such monitoring can be cumbersome and uncomfortable for patients. In this study, we introduce a noninvasive approach to estimate blood glucose levels using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We have focused on blood glucose prediction using wrist PPG signals and explored various PPG waveform-based features, including AC to DC ratio (AC/DC) and intrinsic mode function (IMF)-based features derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been found using EMD-based features to estimate blood glucose levels noninvasively. Additionally, feature importance-based selection has also been used to further improve the accuracy of the proposed model. Among the four machine learning algorithms considered in this study, CatBoost consistently outperformed XGBoost, LightGBM, and random forest across a wide number of features. The best performing model, CatBoost, achieved Pearson's r of 0.96, MSE 0.08, R(2 )score 0.92, and MAE 8.01 when considering the top 50 features selected from both PPG waveform-based features and IMF-based features.

WOS,7,Machine-Learning-Based Noninvasive In Vivo Estimation of HbA1c Using Photoplethysmography Signals,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is an important factor in monitoring diabetes. Since the glycated hemoglobin value reflects the average blood glucose level over 3 months, it is not affected by exercise or food intake immediately prior to measurement. Thus, it is used as the most basic measure of evaluating blood-glucose control over a certain period and predicting the occurrence of long-term complications due to diabetes. However, as the existing measurement methods are invasive, there is a burden on the measurement subject who has to endure increased blood gathering and exposure to the risk of secondary infections. To overcome this problem, we propose a machine-learning-based noninvasive estimation method in this study using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. First, the development of the device used to acquire the PPG signals is described in detail. Thereafter, discriminative and effective features are extracted from the acquired PPG signals using the device, and a machine-learning algorithm is used to estimate the glycated hemoglobin value from the extracted features. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparison with existing model-based methods.",10.3390/s22082963,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/s22082963)

This paper presents a high precision near-infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) based noninvasive glucose monitoring System on Chip (SoC). The proposed system implements a fully differential Analog Frontend (AFE) with nonlinear medium Gaussian support-vector-regression (NMG-SVR) for glucose estimation. The AFE design incorporates chopping which enables the reduction of the integrated input-referred current noise to 9.4pArms thus achieving a dynamic range of 115dB. The glucose prediction processor (GPP) removes noise from the PPG signal, extracts ten unique features, and estimates the blood glucose level using a trained customized NMG-SVR model that minimizes the hardware cost by 25%. The extracted features are carefully designed and implemented to ensure inter-feature dependency, which helps to reduce the overall area by more than 40%. Moreover, GPP is implemented using power and clock gating techniques to minimize both static and dynamic power consumption. The proposed SoC is realized with 0.18 mu m CMOS technology and occupies an area of 6 mm(2).

WOS,12,Blood Glucose Level Regression for Smartphone PPG Signals Using Machine Learning,"Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects millions of people worldwide and requires regular monitoring of a patient's blood glucose level. Currently, blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer-however, this process is uncomfortable for the patient. In this paper, a smartphone video-based noninvasive technique is proposed for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood. The videos are collected steadily from the tip of the subject's finger using smartphone cameras and subsequently converted into a Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. A Gaussian filter is applied on top of the Asymmetric Least Square (ALS) method to remove high-frequency noise, optical noise, and motion interference from the raw PPG signal. These preprocessed signals are then used for extracting signal features such as systolic and diastolic peaks, the time differences between consecutive peaks (DelT), first derivative, and second derivative peaks. Finally, the features are fed into Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models for the prediction of glucose level.

WOS,13,Noninvasive Blood Glucose Detection System With Infrared Pulse Sensor and Hybrid Feature Neural Network,"The rising prevalence of diabetes increases the demand for daily blood glucose (BG) detection, necessitating the urgent development of noninvasive BG detection systems. To enhance the convenience of BG monitoring, we employed infrared pulsed sensing (IPS) to capture photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG signals effectively reflect changes in blood volume within the human body, providing rich information about BG. In this article, we designed a BG detection system based on an IPS and a deep hybrid feature neural network. By deploying IPS and deep learning algorithms on a Raspberry Pi, the system is equipped with data collection, analysis, prediction, and display capabilities for real-time BG monitoring. Previous studies relying on shallow machine learning for BG detection struggled to capture the complex underlying correlations between PPG signals and BG.

The task of minimizing the effect of these perturbations for accurate measurements is an important research area. Therefore, in the present work, galvanic skin response (GSR) and temperature measurements along with PPG were used to measure blood glucose noninvasively. The data extracted from the sensors were used to estimate blood glucose concentration with the help of two machine learning (ML) techniques, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN).

Consequently, there is an increasing need for non-invasive techniques that provide accurate BGL measurements. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a photosensitive method that detects blood volume variations, has shown promise for non-invasive glucose monitoring. Deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to PPG signals can predict BGLs with high accuracy. However, training DNN models requires large and diverse datasets, which are typically distributed across multiple healthcare institutions. Privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions further limit data sharing, making conventional centralized machine learning (ML) approaches less effective. To address these challenges, this study proposes a federated learning (FL)-based solution that enables multiple healthcare organizations to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw patient data, thereby enhancing model performance while ensuring data privacy and security. In the data preprocessing stage, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to smooth PPG signals and remove baseline drift. Adaptive cycle-based segmentation (ACBS) is then used for signal segmentation, followed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection, optimizing classification accuracy. The proposed system was evaluated on diverse datasets, including VitalDB and MUST, under various conditions with data collected during surgery and anesthesia. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.1 mg/dL, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) confirmed the model's clinical reliability, with 99.31% of predictions falling within clinically acceptable limits. The FL-based approach outperformed conventional deep learning models, making it a promising method for non-invasive, privacy-preserving glucose monitoring.",10.3390/bios15040255,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/bios15040255)
WOS,22,Study on Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Detection Technology Based on Time Frequency Domain Analysis,"The non-invasive blood glucose detection technique is an indirect method of measuring glucose levels in the blood, which is safe, fast, and non-invasive without damaging human tissues, breaking the limitations of traditional blood glucose detection, and has important research value. The photoplethysmography signal, containing various physiological and pathological information, is widely used in various clinical studies and is also the focus of attention in the current implementation of the non-invasive glucose detection technique. Current studies of non-invasive blood glucose detection based on photoplethysmography signals have only considered the contribution to system modelling when the time or frequency domains act alone. Although the time domain analysis of the signal can describe the variation of the PPG signal amplitude with time, it cannot visually reflect the energy distribution of the PPG signal frequency. Therefore, the signal analysis of a single domain cannot fully express the PPG signal, which leads to information loss. When using frequency domain analysis to extract the signal spectrum, it is necessary to use all the time domain information of the signal, which is a global transformation and may result in the loss of signal characteristics at a specific time or in a specific frequency band. In summary, this paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on the integrated time-frequency domain analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG), using a parallel time-frequency domain method to consider the association between the photoplethysmography signal and blood glucose, a cluster analysis method is used to extract representative waveforms in the time domain of the PPG signal, analyze the correlation between the waveform features and blood glucose, and determine the time domain feature parameters of the waveform. On this basis, the pulse waveform time domain signal is converted to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform, and the spectral information is studied using principal component analysis to establish the frequency domain characteristic quantities. The BP neural network-based non-invasive blood glucose detection model is constructed by extracting the time-frequency domain feature parameters from the waveform signals obtained through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and using the invasive blood glucose concentration detected in real time as a reference. At the same time, in order to improve the accuracy of the model and achieve model optimization, a genetic algorithm is applied to the model for the second correction, and the final MAE and RMSE of the test set reach 1.13 and 1.42 mmol center dot L-1. The results of Parker's CEG show that the prediction results in the A and B regions accounted for 80.3% and 19.7%, respectively, which indicates that the method has good prediction accuracy and provides a theoretical basis for the feasibility of daily non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. It is beneficial to improve the detection and monitoring systems for diabetes, to judge the condition better comprehensively, and to prevent, guide, and treat diabetes promptly.",10.3964/j.issn.1000-0599-3(2024)02-0318-07,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,23,Diagnostic Accuracy of Smartphone-Connected Electrophysiological Biosensors for Prediction of Blood Glucose Level in a Type-2 Diabetic Patient Using Machine Learning: A Pilot Study,"In this pilot study, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of utilizing smartphone-connected electrophysiological biosensors for measuring blood glucose level (BGL) in a type-2 diabetic (T2D) patient using machine learning (ML). Patients' electrophysiological parameters are measured using commercially available, smartphone operated/embedded electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensors; simultaneously, we measure the BGL of the patient using a minimal invasive (MI) biosensor mounted on the patient's arm. Statistical correlation analysis confirms that a modest correlation exists between the extracted ECG and PPG features and the measured BGL. The efficacy of ML models trained using the regression tree algorithm utilizing ECG and PPG extracted features for predicting the BGL is investigated. Experimental results show that ECG and PPG feature trained ML models can successfully predict BGL upto +/- (8-33 mg/dL) during fasting, pre-prandial, and post-prandial intervals.",10.1109/LES.2021.3096717,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/les.2021.3096717)
WOS,24,Non-invasive blood glucose monitoring using PPG signals with various deep learning models and implementation using TinyML,"Accurate and continuous blood glucose monitoring is essential for effective diabetes management, yet traditional finger pricking methods are often inconvenient and painful. To address this issue, photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising non-invasive alternative for estimating blood glucose levels. In this study, we propose an innovative 1-second signal segmentation method and evaluate the performance of three advanced deep learning models using a novel dataset to estimate blood glucose levels from PPG signals. We also extend our testing to additional datasets to assess the robustness of our models against unseen distributions, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the models' generalizability and specificity and accuracy. Initially, we analyzed 10-second PPG segments; however, our newly developed 1-second signal segmentation technique proved to significantly enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The selected model, after being optimized and deployed on an embedded device, achieved immediate blood glucose estimation with a processing time of just 6.4 seconds, demonstrating the method's practical applicability. The method demonstrated strong generalizability across different populations. Training data was collected during surgery and anesthesia, and the method also performed successfully in normal states using a separate test dataset. The results showed an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 19.7 mg/dL, with 76.6% accuracy within the A zone and 23.4% accuracy within the B zone of the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (CEGA), indicating a 100% clinical acceptance. These findings demonstrate that blood glucose estimation using 1-second PPG signal segments not only outperforms the traditional 10-second segments, but also provides a more convenient and accurate alternative to conventional monitoring methods. The study's results highlight the potential of this approach for non-invasive, accurate, and convenient diabetes management, ultimately offering improved health management.",10.1038/s41598-024-84265-8,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1038/s41598-024-84265-8)
WOS,25,A noninvasive blood glucose detection method with strong time adaptability based on fuzzy operator decision fusion and dynamic spectroscopy characteristics of PPG signals,"PPG signals are a new means of non-invasive detection of blood glucose, but there are still shortcomings of poor time adaptability and low prediction accuracy of blood glucose quantitative models. Few studies discuss prediction accuracy in the case of a large time interval span between modeling and prediction. This paper proposes an automatic optimal threshold baseline removal algorithm based on variational mode decomposition (AOT-VMD), which can adaptively eliminate high-frequency noise and baseline interference for each decomposed IMF modal component and reduce the baseline difference of PPG signals from different days. Furthermore, a fuzzy integral multi-model decision fusion algorithm based on error weight is proposed. The fuzzy integral operator is introduced to make the features with large contributions in each sub-model maintain a high-weight value in the overall prediction mechanism, which improves the prediction accuracy of blood glucose. In this paper, a self-developed portable PPG glucose meter is used to collect PPG signals, and the true blood glucose values for 8 consecutive days are collected by CGM. The proposed algorithm is used to build a model with the first day's data and predict the blood glucose values for the remaining 7 days. The experimental results show that the AOT-VMD preprocessing algorithm and the quantitative regression algorithm of the fuzzy integral multiple model decision fusion algorithm proposed in this paper perform well in measurement accuracy and time adaptability compared with the traditional methods. In addition, the proposed method requires less invasive calibration samples in the modeling stage, achieving high-precision prediction for a long period. 100% of the samples are located in areas A and B of the Clarke area in this experiment, and the algorithm has strong time generalization ability. This innovative method can promote the development of a home blood glucose noninvasive detector.",10.1039/d4ay01697a,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1039/d4ay01697a)
WOS,26,Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Estimation System Based on a Neural Network with Dual-Wavelength Photoplethysmography and Bioelectrical Impedance Measuring,"This study proposed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation system based on dual-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) and bioelectrical impedance measuring technology that can avoid the discomfort created by conventional invasive blood glucose measurement methods while accurately estimating blood glucose. The measured PPG signals are converted into mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, and information entropy. The data obtained by bioelectrical impedance measuring consist of the real part, imaginary part, phase, and amplitude size of 11 types of frequencies, which are converted into features through principal component analyses. After combining the input of seven physiological features, the blood glucose value is finally obtained as the input of the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). To confirm the robustness of the system operation, this study collected data from 40 volunteers and established a database. From the experimental results, the system has a mean squared error of 40.736, a root mean squared error of 6.3824, a mean absolute error of 5.0896, a mean absolute relative difference of 4.4321%, and a coefficient of determination (R Squared, R-2) of 0.997, all of which fall within the clinically accurate region A in the Clarke error grid analyses.",10.3390/s22124452,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/s22124452)
WOS,27,Targeting One-Hour Postmeal Glucose: Is It Time for a Paradigm Switch in Diabetes Management?,"In the management of diabetes, postprandial glycemia (PPG) is usually targeted 2 h after the start of meal. Recent evidences, however, suggest that the value of glycemia at 1 h during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a stronger predictor for developing diabetes than the value at 2 h and that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Studies in cells, animals, and humans suggest that 1-h high glucose is a sufficient stimulus for increasing several cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction, with oxidative stress generation as the possible pathogenetic factor. One-hour glucose might be more dangerous than that at 2 h simply because glycemia is higher at 1 h, during an OGTT and postmeal. The new drugs, able to target better 1 h glycemia and the new noninvasive technologies for glucose monitoring, nowadays may help to change the therapeutic paradigm of targeting PPG at 2 h.",10.1089/dia.2017.0135,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1089/dia.2017.0135)

WOS,29,Intelligent estimation of blood glucose level using wristband PPG signal and physiological parameters,"The inconvenience and risk associated with the regular use of invasive blood glucose measurements has led to tremendous research in this area. This paper proposes the design of a non-invasive blood glucose estimation system using novel Mel frequency cepstral coefficients features of wristband photoplethysmogram signal and physiological parameters. A dataset from 217 participants of a hospital in Cuenca Ecuador is used to validate the proposed model. The support vector regression (SVR) and extreme gradient boost regression (XGBR) techniques are used to estimate blood glucose levels (BGL). The XGBR technique achieves the least value for the standard error of prediction (SEP), 9.78 mg/dL. Further, 5 features are selected from the feature set based on the feature importance in XGBR. The XGBR model with the reduced feature set results in further reduction of SEP value (5.53 mg/dL) with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Standard Clarke error grid analysis and Bland-Altman analysis shows that the predicted glucose values are in the clinically acceptable region.

WOS,30,Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Using Spatiotemporal ECG and PPG Feature Fusion and Weight-Based Choquet Integral Multimodel Approach,"change of blood glucose (BG) level stimulates the autonomic nervous system leading to variation in both human's electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). In this article, we aimed to construct a novel multi-modal framework based on ECG and PPG signal fusion to establish a universal BG monitoring model. This is proposed as a spatiotemporal decision fusion strategy that uses weight-based Choquet integral for BG monitoring. Specifically, the multimodal framework performs three-level fusion. First, ECG and PPG signals are collected and coupled into different pools. Second, the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features in the ECG and PPG signals are extracted through numerical analysis and residual networks, respectively. Furthermore, the suitable temporal statistical features are determined with three feature selection techniques, and the spatial morphological features are compressed by deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, weight-based Choquet integral multimodel fusion is integrated for coupling different BG monitoring algorithms based on the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features. To verify the feasibility of the model, a total of 103 days of ECG and PPG signals encompassing 21 participants were collected in this article. The BG levels of participants ranged between 2.2 and 21.8 mmol/L.

WOS,34,Determination of New Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Detection Method Based on Spectral Decomposition,"Diabetes is a disease of abnormal glucose metabolism that manifests as hyperglycemia. If the glucose level in the blood remains very low or very high for long periods, it could cause serious diseases including tissue damage, stroke, heart disease, blindness and kidney failure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), currently there are around 450 million cases of diabetes in the world. With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for glucose measuring equipment has become increasingly urgent. As the currently popular invasive blood glucose measuring equipment will cause inconvenience and pain to patients and may even cause infections, it will inevitably bring psychological and physiological pressure to patients in the long term. Therefore, the realization of non-invasive blood glucose measurement has important clinical application value. Photoplethysmography(PPG) pulse wave contains abundant information about human cardiovascular physiology and pathology. This paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on spectral decomposition, aiming at the spectral information related to blood glucose concentration changes in the PPG signal that is difficult to observe in the time domain Continuous Wavelet Transform(CWT) is used to decompose the PPG signal from the corresponding scale and details in order to obtain the spectral component amplitude information related to the change of blood glucose concentration. Studies have found that there is a higher correlation between the change in the amplitude of the PPG signal spectral components and the changes in the blood glucose concentration. Through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), the detected blood glucose concentration and the obtained relevant PPG signal spectral components amplitude is modeled by partial least square regression, and the established model is evaluated. The Root Mean Square of Calibration (RMSEC) of the calibration set is 12.47 mg . dL(-1), which is 0.69 mmol . L-1, and the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of the prediction set is 6.21 mg . dL(-1), which is 0.35 mmol . L-1. The agreement between the predicted value of model's blood glucose concentration and the reference value is 96.00%. The results of the OGTT experiments show that the spectral decomposition method can effectively separate the vibration characteristic absorption spectra of blood glucose molecular groups, and the blood glucose spectral component modeling can minimize the impact of physiological variability and various environmental conditions. The prediction results of the model meet the national testing standards (>95%). Clark grid error analysis show that the results predicted by this method can be used for daily blood glucose monitoring of patients.",10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)08-2378-06,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)08-2378-06)

The monitoring is performed by gently pressing a wrist or fingertip onto the chemochromic mixture coating a thin glass or polymer film positioned on the back panel of a smart watch with P PG/HRM (photoplethysmographic/heart rate monitoring sensor). The various chemochromic components measure the absolute values of the following metabolites present in the sweat: acetone, acetone beta-hydroxybutirate, aceto acetate, water, carbon dioxide, lactate anion, pyruvic acid, Na and K salts. Taken together, all these parameters give information about blood glucose concentration, calculated via multivariate analysis based on neural network algorithms built into the sensor. The Clarke Error Grid shows an excellent correlation between data measured by the standard invasive glucose analyser and the present noninvasive sensor, with all points aligned along a 45-degree diagonal and contained almost exclusively in sector A.

Noninvasive in vivo blood-glucose measurements help reduce the pain of piercing human fingertips to collect blood. To facilitate noninvasive measurements, this work proposes a Monte Carlo photon simulation-based model to estimate blood-glucose concentration via photoplethysmography (PPG) on the fingertip. A heterogeneous finger model was exposed to light at 660 nm and 940 nm in the reflectance mode of PPG via Monte Carlo photon propagation. The bio-optical properties of the finger model were also deduced to design the photon simulation model for the finger layers.

Utilizing wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) with machine learning to estimate HbA1c can be a promising method for non-invasive HbA1c monitoring in diabetic patients. This study aims to develop a HbA1c estimation system based on machine learning algorithms using PPG signals obtained from the wrist.

Note that the AC-to-DC ratios for three wavelengths were newly adopted as features in addition to the previously acquired 15 features from the PPG signal and a comparative analysis was performed between the performances of several algorithms. We showed that feature-importance-based selection can improve performance while reducing computational complexity. We also showed that AC-to-DC ratio (AC/DC) features play a dominant role in improving HbA1c estimation performance and, furthermore, a good performance can be obtained without the need for external features such as BMI and SpO(2).

This trial tested a wrist-borne non-invasive glucose monitor (NIGM) to measure blood glucose (BG) levels using photoplethysmographic (PPG) optical sensors. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of the device in comparison with a standard, invasive clinical method for blood glucose monitoring. Adult participants (n = 200) of both sexes from 18 to 75 were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria: hemophilia and other serious coagulation disorders, impaired venous access, other serious medical conditions. A biosensor was placed on the right wrist of each participant for a non-invasive indirect BG measurement. In parallel, blood from the antecubital vein was collected and glucose levels were assessed with YSI 2300 Bioanalyzer. The measurements were performed twice: before and after food intake, with a 1-h interval between measurements. There were no limitations to food type and quantity. In both anteprandial (rho = 0.8994, p < 0.0001) and postprandial (rho = 0.9382, p < 0.0001) glucose measurements, NIGM correlated with values obtained by the YSI 2300 reference device - there was no significant difference between the two methods. Plotted on a Parkes Error Grid for Type II diabetes, NIGM readings did not deviate from those of the YSI 2300 in any clinically-significant way, with the majority of correlated readings falling within Parkes zone A. Very few readings fell within Parkes zone B. In anteprandial measurements, the mean bias between methods for all patient volunteers was 3.705 +/- 7.838. In postprandial measurements gave a mean bias of 1.362 +/- 10.15 for all patient glucose data. The mean absolute relative difference of currently available glucometer models ranges from 5.6% to 20.8%. The NIGM falls in the lower end of this error range at 7.40-7.54%, indicating that PPG-chemochrome sensors are capable of producing results comparable with those of direct measure glucometers. Data presented here demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the NIGM system as an adjunctive, and perhaps substitutive, non-invasive tool for blood glucose monitoring.",10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.12.014,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2018.12.014)
WOS,41,Noninvasive Hemoglobin Level Prediction in a Mobile Phone Environment: State of the Art Review and Recommendations,"Background: There is worldwide demand for an affordable hemoglobin measurement solution, which is a particularly urgent need in developing countries. The smartphone, which is the most penetrated device in both rich and resource-constrained areas, would be a suitable choice to build this solution. Consideration of a smartphone-based hemoglobin measurement tool is compelling because of the possibilities for an affordable, portable, and reliable point-of-care tool by leveraging the camera capacity, computing power, and lighting sources of the smartphone. However, several smartphone-based hemoglobin measurement techniques have encountered significant challenges with respect to data collection methods, sensor selection, signal analysis processes, and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive methods is required to recommend a hemoglobin measurement process using a smartphone device. Objective: In this study, we analyzed existing invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive approaches for blood hemoglobin level measurement with the goal of recommending data collection techniques, signal extraction processes, feature calculation strategies, theoretical foundation, and machine-learning algorithms for developing a noninvasive hemoglobin level estimation point-of-care tool using a smartphone. Methods: We explored research papers related to invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive hemoglobin level measurement processes. We investigated the challenges and opportunities of each technique. We compared the variation in data collection sites, biosignal processing techniques, theoretical foundations, photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal and features extraction process, machine-learning algorithms, and prediction models to calculate hemoglobin levels. This analysis was then used to recommend realistic approaches to build a smartphone-based point-of-care tool for hemoglobin measurement in a noninvasive manner. Results: The fingertip area is one of the best data collection sites from the body, followed by the lower eye conjunctival area. Near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diode (LED) light with wavelengths of 850 nm, 940 nm, and 1070 nm were identified as potential light sources to receive a hemoglobin response from living tissue. PPG signals from fingertip videos, captured under various light sources, can provide critical physiological clues. The features of PPG signals captured under 1070 nm and 850 nm NIR LED are considered to be the best signal combinations following a dual-wavelength theoretical foundation. For error metrics presentation, we recommend the mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plot. Conclusions: We addressed the challenges of developing an affordable, portable, and reliable point-of-care tool for hemoglobin measurement using a smartphone. Leveraging the smartphone's camera capacity, computing power, and lighting sources, we define specific recommendations for practical point-of-care solution development. We further provide recommendations to resolve several long-standing research questions, including how to capture a signal using a smartphone camera, select the best body sitefor signal collection, and overcome noise issues in the smartphone-captured signal. We also describe the process of extracting a signal's features after capturing the signal based on fundamental theory. The list of machine-learning algorithms provided will be useful for processing PPG features. These recommendations should be valuable for future investigators seeking to build a reliable and affordable hemoglobin prediction model using a smartphone.",10.2196/16806,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,42,Noninvasive Diagnostic Methods for Better Screening of Peripheral Arterial Disease,"Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to extremities, usually legs. It does not receive enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain while walking which is known as claudication. It is a common manifestation of type-2 Diabetes, but the relationship between other vascular diseases and lower limb peripheral arterial disease (LLPAD) has been poorly understood and investigated. Methods: When assessing a patient with clinical LLPAD, 2 methods are used to establish a diagnosis: one is noninvasive testing and other is invasive. Invasive methods are painful and get so bad that some people need to have a leg surgery. People with diabetes are at increased risk for amputation, and it is used only when the damage is very severe. Results: Diagnosis of LLPAD begins with a physical examination, patient history, and certain questionnaire, and noninvasive mode of diagnosis is started for the screening of patients. Clinicians check for weak pulses in the legs and then decide for further diagnosis. This article discusses the prevalence of LLPAD worldwide and in India, along with the clinical effectiveness and limitations of these methods in case of diabetes. Conclusions: The focus of this review is to discuss only those noninvasive methods that are widely used for screening of LLPAD, such as ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and use of photoplethysmogram (PPG) especially in case of diabetic patients. Also, this article gives an overview of the work carried out using ABI, TBI, and PPG for detection of LLPAD. These tests are not painful and could be performed in a cost-effective manner to avoid delays in screening/diagnosis and also reduce costs.",10.1016/j.avsg.2018.03.018,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.avsg.2018.03.018)
WOS,43,PPG-Based Smart Wearable Device With Energy-Efficient Computing for Mobile Health-Care Applications,"Individualized health-care is gaining traction recently due to the advances in sensor technology, edge computing and the improvement in communication technologies. In this work, we show the application of wearable device for mobile health-care along with supporting algorithms using photoplethysmogram (PPG) as our signal source. We introduce the design of our wearable device equipped PPG sensors for extracting valuable bio-information from the human body. Using our device, we introduce Centralized State Sensing (CSS), an algorithm that improves the estimation of different health parameters. By using heart rate estimation as an example, the proposed algorithm is 26.8% better in terms of mean absolute error when compared with the average reading taken across sensors. We also propose a deep neural network model applied to a PPG-glucose dataset containing 349 samples provided by our industry partner for non-invasive blood glucose estimation achieving an accuracy of 84.29% based on ISO:15197:2013 standard.",10.1109/JSEN.2021.3069460,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/jsen.2021.3069460)
WOS,44,Power spectral density-based nearinfrared sub-band detection for noninvasive blood glucose prediction in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies,"Diabetes is a widespread and serious disease and noninvasive measurement has been in high demand. To address this problem, a power spectral density-based method was offered for determining glucose sensitive sub-bands in the nearinfrared (NIR) spectrum. The experiments were conducted using phantoms of different optical properties in-vitro conditions. The optical bands 1200-1300 nm and 2100-2200 nm were found feasible for measuring blood glucose. After that, a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based low cost and portable optical system was designed. It has six different NIR wavelength LEDs for illumination and an InGaAs photodiode for detection. Optical density values were calculated through the system and used as independent variables for multiple linear regression analysis. The results of blood glucose levels for 24 known healthy subjects showed that the optical system prediction was nearly 80% in the A zone and 20% in the B zone according to the Clarke Error Grid analysis. It was shown that a promising easy-use, continuous, and compact optical system had been designed.",10.1142/S1793545818500359,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1142/s1793545818500359)
WOS,45,A Novel Technique for Non-Invasive Measurement of Human Blood Component Levels From Fingertip Video Using DNN Based Models,"Blood components such as hemoglobin, glucose, creatinine measuring are essential for monitoring one's health condition. The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful, and uncomfortable for the patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine level based on PPG signal using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1st and 2nd) and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included to feature because of the significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and over-fitting. Finally, DNN based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R-2 = 0.922 for Hb, R-2 = 0.902 for Gl, and R-2 = 0.969 for Cr. Experimental aftermaths show that the proposed method is a suitable technique to be used clinically to measure human blood component levels without taking blood samples. This paper also reveals that smartphone-based PPG signal has a great potential to measure the different blood components.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3054236,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/access.2021.3054236)
WOS,47,A method for obtaining dynamic spectrum based on the proportion of multi-wavelength PPG waveform and applying it to noninvasive detection of human platelet content,"Dynamic spectroscopy (DS) theoretically eliminates individual differences and the impact of measurement conditions on accuracy and can achieve high-precision noninvasive blood component analysis. To further improve the extraction quality of DS, this paper proposes a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal waveform proportion extraction method, which realizes the extraction of DS by calculating the proportion coefficient between PPG waveforms. To verify the effectiveness of our method, the transmission spectra of 146 volunteers' fingers and the true value of platelet content (wavelength 600-1100 nm, platelet content range 32 x 10(9)/L-512 x 10(9)/L) were collected. Then the DS was extracted by the single-trail method and this method, and the prediction model is established by PLS. The experimental data showed, compared with the single-trail method, that the modeling effect of the PPG waveform proportion method is significantly improved, the Rc increased 9.61%, the RMSEc decreased 31.56%, the MAPc decreased from 12 to 6%, and the Rp increased 42.92%, the RMSEP reduced 24.39%, and MAPp decreased from 13 to 11%. The results show that the PPG waveform proportion method proposed in this paper has a higher model correlation coefficient and lower prediction error, significantly improves the extraction quality of DS, further improves the accuracy of noninvasive blood component quantitative analysis, and helps to promote the application process of noninvasive detection of blood components.",10.1007/s00216-022-04160-x,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,48,A novel multipurpose device for dataset creation and on-device immediate estimation of blood glucose level from reflection ppg,"We propose a completely non-invasive and highly accurate portable blood glucose estimator, which is simple hardware that anyone, regardless of their prior experience or knowledge, can use to obtain an immediate reading of their blood sugar level. Glucose levels can be monitored in real time and displayed on the device thanks to its infrared LED light source, sensor with built-in amplification unit, processing unit with blood glucose regression model, power management unit for autonomous operation, and display. The device was initially used to create a dataset of photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals collected from the fingertip of 50 subjects. The extracted signal features were correlated with the subject's glucose level, which was measured at the same time using a commercial glucometer, and several regression models were constructed. The models were evaluated using signals from up to 110 subjects across three datasets, and the most optimized model was implemented in the device to predict the subject's blood glucose level solely based on PPG in real-time. The device with the built-in model has been subjected to extensive testing to gauge its efficacy. The device's clinical accuracy is encouraging. The pricey strips and needles that must be purchased along with the hardware in the conventional method will no longer be necessary with this device.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19553,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e19553)
WOS,49,Synchronizing chaotification with support vector machine and wolf pack search algorithm for estimation of peripheral vascular occlusion in diabetes mellitus,"This study proposes a method for the estimation of peripheral vascular occlusion (PVO) in diabetic foot using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm. The long-term presence of elevated blood sugar levels commonly results in peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with PVO disease have decreased walking capability and life quality in diabetes mellitus and poor peripheral circulation of PVO causes morbidity like infection and amputation of the legs or feet of diabetics. This progressively vascular occlusion is often ignored by the patients and primary care physicians in early stage. Therefore, a reliable method of diagnostic assistance is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring of PVO and prevention of amputation. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for detecting blood volume changes in peripheral vascular bed. Literature indicates that the pulse transit time increases and waveform shape changes increase in PPG of the vascular occlusion. PPG pulses of feet gradually become asynchronous due to the different speed of deteriorating patency and collateral circulation in the peripheral arteries. We utilized synchronizing chaotification to compare the bilateral similarity and asymmetry of PPG signals, and applied SVM to estimate three degrees of PVO. Among 33 subjects tested, this classification technique could recognize various butterfly motion patterns representing severities successfully including normal condition, lower-degree disease, and higher-degree disease. The proposed method has potential for providing diagnostic assistance for PVO of diabetics and other high-risk populations, with efficiency and higher accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

WOS,50,Integrating Sphere Finger-Photoplethysmography: Preliminary Investigation towards Practical Non-Invasive Measurement of Blood Constituents,"The aim of this study was to compare conventional photoplethysmography (PPG) in a finger with PPG using an integrating sphere ((IS)PPG) to enhance scattered light collection. Two representative wavelengths were used; 1160 nm, a window through the absorption spectra of water and alcohol, and 1600 nm around where water absorption is high and there is an absorption peak of blood glucose. Simultaneous transmission-type measurements were made with conventional PPG and with (IS)PPG for each wavelength in the tips of index fingers of both hands in a total of 10 healthy young male and female volunteers (21.7 +/- 1.6 years old). During a 5 min period in which subjects were in a relaxed state we determined the signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and the PPG detectability (or sensitivity) by the two techniques. SNR during the test period was significantly higher with (IS)PPG as compared with conventional PPG, especially for the 1600 nm wavelength. PPG signals with 1600 nm could scarcely be detected by conventional PPG, while they could be detected with good sensitively by (IS)PPG. We conclude that under controlled conditions (IS)PPG has better SNR and higher sensitivity than conventional transmission PPG, especially in wavelength regions where water absorption is high but where there is potential for practical measurement of blood constituents including glucose.",10.1371/journal.pone.0143506,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1371/journal.pone.0143506)
WOS,51,Type 2 Diabetes Detection With Light CNN From Single Raw PPG Wave,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive and cost-efficient optical technique used to assess blood volume variations in the microcirculation. PPG technology is widely used in a variety of wearable sensors to investigate the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of PPG analysis for carrying out large-scale screening to prevent and detect diabetes. However, most of these studies require feature extraction and/or several pre-processing steps. Over the past few years, the advent of deep learning has significantly impacted the analysis of biomedical signals. Despite their success in other fields, however, very few studies have focused on the application of deep learning to raw PPG signals for detecting diabetes. Existing studies have proposed large models trained on large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a Light CNN-based model for screening the presence of type 2 diabetes using a single raw pulse extracted from photoplethysmographic signals. In addition to the baseline architecture, we evaluate different model architectures that take as input age and biological sex or PPG handcrafted features. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to all the tested architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of harnessing pre-trained models in detecting diabetes. We tested a model pre-trained on a general PPG shape dataset and another model pre-trained on a dataset containing hypertension PPG signals. Our model scored an AUC of 75.5 when trained with raw PPG waves, age, and biological sex without applying transfer learning, which is competitive with current state of the art.",10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3274484,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/access.2023.3274484)
WOS,52,The effect of spectral photoplethysmography amplification and its application in dynamic spectrum for effective noninvasive detection of blood components,"Maximum and accurate information of blood components are expected by clinicians during medical sample detection and disease monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and its morphological features are commonly used for measurement and analysis but significant fundamental limitations including spectral noise, interaction of subjects' variability portions (skin, fat and muscle) and the absorbing components (water, and blood) still affects the quality of the PPG morphology in optical based extractions of blood components and spectral monitoring. Dynamic spectrum (DS) is a potential clinical method to consider these effect in the physiological PPG sample. In this article, we proposed a novel filtering DS based method using adaptive time varying filter (ATVF) to consider the effect and meaning of spectral amplification of the physiological PPG signal. The spectrum PPG sample was partitioned into two equal halves of upper and lower (UL) sample to ensure spectral amplification and analysis with DS. The results from 184 clinical volunteers confirms that spectrum PPG signal amplification significantly influences the accuracy of the noninvasive optical analysis of blood components by adding noise effect due to signal weakening but increases the spectral component. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network modeling of the calibration and prediction data sets shows the performance of the proposed ATVF-UL extraction by reducing significantly the induced noise effect for smooth DS component and maximum detection of blood components.",10.1016/j.optlastec.2020.106515,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,53,Side-scattered finger-photoplethysmography: experimental investigations toward practical noninvasive measurement of blood glucose,"The aim of this study was to discover a simple/convenient geometrical arrangement of radiation sources and detector to acquire finger-photoplethysmograms (PPGs) with wavelength regions of blood glucose (BGL) absorption, toward practical noninvasive BGL measurement. First, we compared PPGs with three wavelengths: 808 nm (without water absorption), 1160 nm (with weak water absorption), and 1600 nm (with nearly peak BGL absorption and strong water absorption), while the source-detector spacing was successively increased circumferentially around a fingertip. In 10 healthy subjects, we observed clear cardiac-related pulsatile components of PPG signals at 808 and 1160 nm in any incident positions with more than 15 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), but reliable PPG detections at 1600 nm with more than 10 dB of S/N was only possible when the source-detector distance was less than 3mm around the fingertip circumference. Second, with this arrangement, an experiment was performed using six wavelengths to cover glucose absorption bands (from 1550 to 1749 nm), obtaining pulsatile PPG signals with more or less 15 dB of S/N. Through the present experiments, this orthogonal arrangement of the source and detector to detect forward-and side-scattered radiation through the tissue is appropriate for PPG measurements with wavelength regions where there is potential for BGL measurement.

WOS,54,Using Machine learning to predict blood glucose level based on Photoplethysmography,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique used to monitor the tiny changes in blood vessels caused by the heartbeat. This study obtained PPG signals from a commercial PPG module, followed by Signal Quality Index (SQI) detection to assess the signal quality and further signal processing, such as filtering and baseline shift. As a result, a total of 36 features were extracted from PPG signals in both time and frequency domains, and a correlation matrix was used to inspect the correlation among features. Machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to train and predict blood glucose levels. Of the 36 features, 9 were selected for use as input data for red and infrared light signals. Four datasets, namely Red, Infrared, Composite (a combination of Red and Infrared), and Modified Composite (a refined version of the Composite dataset that reduces feature collinearity and enhances prediction accuracy), were investigated. The RF model trained with the Modified Composite dataset yielded the best prediction, with a Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) of 5.15% and an R-value of 0.93.",10.1016/j.measurement.2025.117421,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.measurement.2025.117421)
WOS,55,Estimation of blood glucose by non-invasive method using photoplethysmography,"This paper presents a system which estimates blood glucose level (BGL) by non-invasive method using Photoplethysmography (PPG). Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the PPG signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a PPG signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of BGL values. A PPG data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. BGL value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and BGL value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of BGL value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R-2=0.81. Further, BGL estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R-2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for BGL estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6% in class A and 17.4% in class B. 1% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique (SPA) the distribution of data samples are 83% in class A and 17% in class B. The proposed features in SPA have shown significant improvement in R-2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. SPA technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer.",10.1007/s12046-019-1118-9,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1007/s12046-019-1118-9)
WOS,56,Non-invasive estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph by means of machine learning techniques,"Objective: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were R-SBP(2) = 0.91, R-DBP(2) = 0.89, and R-BGL(2) = 0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7% of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B. and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

However, its potential as a painless marker of blood glucose concentration remains to be explored. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of perfusion index (PI) in estimating blood glucose using conventional and ultrasound-assisted finger photo-plethysmography (PPG) in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range.Method: A customized module combining a reflective PPG sensor with a peak emission wavelength of 940 nm and an ultrasonic sensor with an operating frequency of 40 kHz was developed. 4-min PPG recordings (two minutes with ultrasound; two minutes without ultrasound) were acquired from 53 volunteers, including 19 diabetic patients, after conventional blood sample collection via an invasive glucometer. We computed Pearson's coef-ficient (r), the mean absolute error (MAE), Bland-Altman plots, and Clarke error grids to explore the relationship between PI and glucose values and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, with and without ultrasound.Results: When ultrasonic waves were applied, PI showed a higher correlation with blood glucose levels (r =-0.90, p < 0.001), MAE significantly decreased (p = 0.0051), the bias was slightly closer to zero, the LOA interval became narrower, and predicted glucose levels deviating from reference values by more than 20 % decreased in number.Conclusions: There is an association between PI and the blood glucose level, and 40 kHz ultrasound can signif-icantly increase the accuracy in estimating the blood glucose level through PI.",10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105338,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105338)
WOS,58,Continuous Glycemic Monitoring Enabled by A Wi-Fi Energy-Harvesting Wearable Sweat-Sensing Patch,"Continuous monitoring of multiple physiological parameters, such as glucose levels, temperature, and heart rate variability (HRV) is crucial for effective diabetes management and mitigating the risks associated with hypoglycemic events. These events often occur without apparent symptoms, posing a challenge for diabetic patients in managing their condition. Therefore, a non-invasive wearable device capable of continuously measuring multiple body signals to predict hypoglycemic events would be highly beneficial. In this study, a wearable patch that continuously measures glucose, temperature, and HRV is presented. The device uses a novel power harvesting system to convert radiofrequency (RF) signals with the frequency of 2.45 GHz to direct current (DC) signals to extend the battery life for further continuous monitoring. The patch is small and has a conformal structure that can easily fit onto different body parts. The screen-printed glucose sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of 10.3 nA cm-2 mu M-1, a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.9 mu M, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 27 mu M. The device employs a photoplethysmography (PPG) module with a peak-finding algorithm to calculate the HRV values. In vivo experiments demonstrate the validation of the device's proper operation in glucose, HRV, and temperature measurement. This study introduces a wearable patch for diabetes management, employing a unique Wi-Fi energy harvesting system for extended battery life.

WOS,59,Implicit HbA1c Achieving 87% Accuracy within 90 Days in Non-Invasive Fasting Blood Glucose Measurements Using Photoplethysmography,"To reduce the error induced by overfitting or underfitting in predicting non-invasive fasting blood glucose (NIBG) levels using photoplethysmography (PPG) data alone, we previously demonstrated that incorporating HbA1c led to a notable 10% improvement in NIBG prediction accuracy (the ratio in zone A of Clarke's error grid). However, this enhancement came at the cost of requiring an additional HbA1c measurement, thus being unfriendly to users. In this study, the enhanced HbA1c NIBG deep learning model (blood glucose level predicted from PPG and HbA1c) was trained with 1494 measurements, and we replaced the HbA1c measurement (explicit HbA1c) with implicit HbA1c which is reversely derived from pretested PPG and finger-pricked blood glucose levels. The implicit HbA1c is then evaluated across intervals up to 90 days since the pretest, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy, while the remaining 13% falls near the CEG zone A boundary. The implicit HbA1c approach exhibits a remarkable 16% improvement over the explicit HbA1c method by covering personal correction items automatically. This improvement not only refines the accuracy of the model but also enhances the practicality of the previously proposed model that relied on an HbA1c input. The nonparametric Wilcoxon paired test conducted on the percentage error of implicit and explicit HbA1c prediction results reveals a substantial difference, with a p-value of 2.75 x 10-7.",10.3390/bioengineering10101207,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/bioengineering10101207)

The radial pulse and PPG signals were measured at the beginning of the trial. Kaplan-Meier curves of the DR risk indicator was analyzed. In addition, the correlation between the measurements of the radial pulse and PPG was evaluated. Results: In comparison of the patients' clinical characteristics, years of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, ACR, urinary albumin and fourth harmonic (C4) were higher in the DR group, and eGFR and third harmonic (C3) were lower. Patients in the high-DR risk group had a 1.8-fold higher risk of developing retinopathy than those in the low-risk group (log-rank test, p < 0.001). The correlation coefficient between radial pulse and PPG mea-surements for C3 and C4 were 0.727 and 0.628, respectively.Conclusions: The harmonic analysis of radial pulse and PPG signals may be used to reflect the effect of DR in hemodynamics and the derived harmonic components may predict the risk of DR of patients with type 2 diabetes.",10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2022.108306,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2022.108306)
WOS,61,Non-invasive blood glucose estimation using a novel white-box model: An interpretable machine learning approach,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal analysis by machine learning (ML) algorithms is a promising development in the field of non-invasive blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring. In this work, we report a comprehensive set of protocols to estimate BGL from the raw PPG time-series. The protocol is trained on 1153 distinct entries. Pre-processing was done using Kalman smoothing for noise reduction, wavelet-based baseline correction, and the AMPD algorithm for automatic trough detection. The protocol includes extensive feature extraction of 392 features including single pulse area-based features of which 26 features were determined as statistically significant. Of the various machine learning (ML) models trained on these features, the Voting regressor performed best, yielding an R2 value of 0.921. We further trained a human interpretable (novel white-box) model using PySR which also yielded a remarkably high R2 value of 0.815. Importantly, the study demonstrates successful feature reduction, showing that even with a smaller set of features, predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and clinical relevance (as demonstrated by Clarke Error Grids, 90% and 70% in zone A for black and white-box models respectively) remain largely unaffected. The white-box model in non-invasive BGL estimation significantly enhances interpretability, making it highly suitable for clinical applications where transparency and reliability are crucial.",10.1016/j.bspc.2025.107520,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.bspc.2025.107520)
WOS,62,A Correlational Study on Cardiopulmonary Endurance in Male Patients with New-Onset Type 2 Diabetes,"Background: Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) are widely used non-invasive and reliable functional evaluation methods. This study investigated the correlation between cardiopulmonary endurance indices and plasma glucose levels and abdominal visceral fat in males with new-onset type 2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 136 male individuals, who had been treated in the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao City, were selected to form a new-onset type 2 diabetes group (66 cases) and a control group (70 cases); individuals were divided into three groups (Q1, Q2, and Q3) from low to high according to their anaerobic threshold (AT) oxygen uptake (VO2), AT VO2/kg (VO2 per kg of body weight), peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT heart rate (HR), peak HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. A cardiopulmonary exercise test was used to determine the VO2 of each group of subjects for VO2 max and AT VO2/kg, HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. The differences in fat areas and plasma glucose levels were compared under different cardiorespiratory endurance indicators. Results: Compared with the control group, the abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels increased in the new-onset type 2 diabetes group. Concurrently, AT VO2, AT VO2/kg, peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT HR, peak HR, and 1-minute HR recovery all decreased, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). The higher the AT VO2 and peak VO2 values, the lower the PPG level (P<0.05) and the smaller the area of abdominal visceral fat (P<0.05). The AT VO2/kg and peak VO2/kg values were negatively correlated with the abdominal visceral fat area, while other indicators had no obvious relationship with either plasma glucose levels or the area of fat. Conclusion: The levels of blood glucose and visceral fat are correlated with cardiopulmonary function. With the increase in blood glucose levels and visceral fat, the indices of cardiopulmonary function gradually decrease. The correlation between different cardiopulmonary function indices and blood glucose levels and visceral fat was different.",10.2147/DMSO.S352798,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.2147/dmso.s352798)

WOS,64,Convenient prediction of TcPO2 level using machine learning techniques with the PPG signal's characteristic features,"Background: Transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) is a noninvasive method for assessing the oxygen supply of the skin in clinics. However, it is difficult to deploy broadly in primary care settings due to its high cost and timeconsuming. This study proposed a fast and inexpensive technique for predicting TcPO2 using the characteristic features of the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and various machine learning algorithms. Methods: The toe PPG signals of 149 subjects were collected, and 12 characteristic features were extracted according to contour analysis, followed by TcPO2 measurements. TcPO2 measurements were performed on the dorsum of the foot by PeriFlux 6000 TcPO2 system. In addition to PPG features, physiological parameters were also taken into account. A variety of machine learning regression approaches, including extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and Ridge regression (Ridge), were used to predict TcPO2 levels. To evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, different performance indicators such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient were employed. Correlation analysis and BlandAltman plot analysis were performed to visualize the data. Results: XGBoost outperformed the other three regression models in predicting TcPO2 (R = 0.835, MAE = 5.23 mmHg, RMSE = 6.87 mmHg, MAPE = 9.99%). Reflection index, diabetes, duration of diabetes, heart rate, crest time, the time between the systolic and diastolic peaks (& UDelta;T) were the top six contributions to TcPO2 prediction in the XGBoost model. The PPG characteristic features play a dominant role in TcPO2 estimation. Diabetes and duration of diabetes were also significant factors in TcPO2 prediction. Conclusions: We compared four machine learning methods for TcPO2 prediction. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance of all the algorithms investigated and could be used to forecast TcPO2 values. The TcPO2 prediction model based on PPG signal reduces the cost and shortens the measurement time of TcPO2, providing significant benefits for primary care.",10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105088,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105088)
WOS,65,"Photoplethysmography in Wearable Devices: A Comprehensive Review of Technological Advances, Current Challenges, and Future Directions","Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an affordable and straightforward optical technique used to detect changes in blood volume within tissue microvascular beds. PPG technology has found widespread application in commercial medical devices, enabling measurements of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and cardiac output; the assessment of autonomic nerve function; and the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. Recently, the growing demand for non-invasive, portable, cost-effective technology, along with advancements in small semiconductor components, has led to the integration of PPG into various wrist-worn wearable devices. Multiple sensor structures have been proposed and, through appropriate signal processing and algorithmic application, these wearable devices can measure a range of health indicators during daily life. This paper begins by addressing the market status of wrist-worn wearable devices, followed by an explanation of the fundamental principles underlying light operation and its interaction with living tissue for PPG measurements. Moving on to technological advancements, the paper addresses the analog front end for the measurement of the PPG signal, sensor configurations with multiple light emitters and receivers, the minimum sampling rate required for low-power systems, and the measurement of stress, sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, and activity using PPG signals. Several challenges in the field are also identified, including selecting the appropriate wavelength for the PPG sensor's light source, developing low-power interpolation methods to extract high-resolution inter-beat intervals at a low sampling rate, and exploring the measurement of physiological phenomena using multi-wavelength PPG signals simultaneously collected at the same location.

In addition, diabetes which is linked to cardiovascular diseases is classified, and an accuracy of 88.46% is achieved. Considering the PPG signal with a higher signal quality index, the overall accuracy for all the diseases can be further increased.

Wearable devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic, bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection.

WOS,68,90% Accuracy for Photoplethysmography-Based Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Prediction by Deep Learning with Cohort Arrangement and Quarterly Measured HbA1c,"Previously published photoplethysmography-(PPG) based non-invasive blood glucose (NIBG) measurements have not yet been validated over 500 subjects. As illustrated in this work, we increased the number subjects recruited to 2538 and found that the prediction accuracy (the ratio in zone A of Clarke's error grid) reduced to undesirable 60.6%. We suspect the low prediction accuracy induced by larger sample size might arise from the physiological diversity of subjects, and one possibility is that the diversity might originate from medication. Therefore, we split the subjects into two cohorts for deep learning: with and without medication (1682 and 856 recruited subjects, respectively). In comparison, the cohort training for subjects without any medication had approximately 30% higher prediction accuracy over the cohort training for those with medication. Furthermore, by adding quarterly (every 3 months) measured glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), we were able to significantly boost the prediction accuracy by approximately 10%. For subjects without medication, the best performing model with quarterly measured HbA1c achieved 94.3% prediction accuracy, RMSE of 12.4 mg/dL, MAE of 8.9 mg/dL, and MAPE of 0.08, which demonstrates a very promising solution for NIBG prediction via deep learning.

WOS,69,Quantitative Analysis of Different Multi-Wavelength PPG Devices and Methods for Noninvasive In-Vivo Estimation of Glycated Hemoglobin,"Diabetes is a serious disease affecting the insulin cycle in the human body. Thus, monitoring blood glucose levels and the diagnosis of diabetes in the early stages is very important. Noninvasive in vivo diabetes-diagnosis procedures are very new and require thorough studies to be error-resistant and user-friendly. In this study, we compare two noninvasive procedures (two-wavelength- and three-wavelength-based methods) to estimate glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in different scenarios and evaluate them with error level calculations. The three-wavelength method, which has more model parameters, results in a more accurate estimation of HbA1c even when the blood oxygenation (SpO(2)) values change. The HbA1c-estimation error range of the two-wavelength model, due to change in SpO(2), is found to be from -1.306% to 0.047%. On the other hand, the HbA1c estimation error for the three-wavelength model is found to be in the magnitude of 10(-14)% and independent of SpO(2). The approximation of SpO(2) from the two-wavelength model produces a lower error for the molar concentration based technique (-4% to -1.9% at 70% to 100% of reference SpO(2)) as compared to the molar absorption coefficient based technique. Additionally, the two-wavelength model is less susceptible to sensor noise levels (max SD of %error, 0.142%), as compared to the three-wavelength model (max SD of %error, 0.317%). Despite having a higher susceptibility to sensor noise, the three-wavelength model can estimate HbA1c values more accurately; this is because it takes the major components of blood into account and thus becomes a more realistic model.",10.3390/app11156867,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/app11156867)
WOS,70,Wearable-band type visible-near infrared optical biosensor for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring,"Diabetes is a worldwide-serious problem that can only be delayed or prevented by a regular monitoring of blood glucose (BG) concentration level. Continuous monitoring systems allow subjects to prepare the diabetes management strategy and prevent the long-term complications diseases. Until now, most studies utilize various biofluids such as sweat, tears and saliva that have serious unresolved setback such as expensive material, sensor stability, sensor calibration and long-settling time. Therefore, we developed a novel BG sensor which is cost efficient and highly wearable with a small data acquisition time window that allow a non-invasive, long-term continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) system. The novel biosensor exploits a unique information of the pulsatile to continuous components of the arterial blood volume pulsation during the change of blood glucose (BG) concentration at the wrist tissue. The reflected optical signal was measured in the combine visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. An in-vivo experiment which enclosed 12 volunteers in a two-hour modified carbohydrate-rich meals reached the average correlation coefficient (R-p) between the estimated and reference BG concentration of 0.86, with the standard prediction error (SPE) of 6.16 mg/dl. Moreover, the full-day experiment was also conducted to test the reliability of the proposed sensor. Results showed that the created model in the previous day, may estimate a full-day BG concentration which was done in next day with an adequate performance.",10.1016/j.snb.2019.01.121,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,71,Feasibility of home-based tracking of insulin resistance from vascular stiffness estimated from the photoplethysmographic finger pulse waveform,"Objective. In this study we explored the utility of post-prandial vascular stiffness as a surrogate measure for estimating insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic condition. Approach. A cohort of 51 healthy young adults with varying body mass index (BMI) values was studied using fasting plasma values of insulin and glucose, fasting and post-meal finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance 2 (HOMA-IR2) using fasting plasma insulin and glucose. Vascular stiffness was estimated by reciprocal of pulse arrival time (rPAT) from ECG and finger PPG at five time points from fasting to 2 h post-oral glucose ingestion. We examined if insulin resistance correlates with meal-induced vascular stiffness changes, supporting the feasibility of using finger PPG to estimate insulin resistance. Main results. HOMA-IR2 was positively correlated with an early rise (0 to 30 min post-meal) and delayed fall (30 to 120 min post-meal) of rPAT. Correlation persisted even after the effect of BMI has been partialled out in subgroup analysis. We conclude that finger PPG-based pulse waveform and single-lead ECG has the potential to be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of insulin resistance. Significance. As both signals, namely ECG and PPG, can be easily acquired using wearable and other low-cost sensing systems, the present study can serve as a pointer to develop accessible strategies for monitoring and longitudinal tracking of insulin resistance in health and pathophysiological states.",10.1088/1361-6579/ac6d3f,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1088/1361-6579/ac6d3f)
WOS,72,Pulse Power Generation Chronoamperometry as an Advanced Readout for (Bio)sensors: Application for Noninvasive Diabetes Monitoring,"We propose pulse power generation (PPG) amperometry as an advanced readout realized for Prussian blue (PB)-based (bio)sensors. In contrast to the conventional power generation mode, when the current response is generated upon continuous short-circuiting, the suggested pulse regime is fulfilled by periodic opening and shorting of the circuit. Despite PB being electroactive, the pulse readout is advantageous over conventional steady-state power generation, providing up to a 15-fold increased signal-to-background ratio as well as dramatically improved sensitivity exceeding 10 A center dot M-1 center dot cm-2 for H2O2 sensors and 3.9 A center dot M-1 center dot cm-2 for glucose biosensors. Such analytical performance characteristics are, most probably, achieved due to the enrichment of the diffusion layer by analyte mass transfer from the bulk upon opening of the circuit. Due to an improved sensitivity-to-background ratio, reduced flow rate dependence, and enhanced operational stability, the regime allows reliable monitoring of blood glucose variations through sweat analysis with the on-skin device.",10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05746,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05746)

The complications associated with DM-2 involve cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. This article proposes the Fourier decomposition method for non-invasive automated type-2 diabetes detection using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The proposed research work comprises three major phases. In the first phase, the 5-min duration of the toe PPG signal is split into 10-s segments and decomposed into frequency subbands known as Fourier intrinsic band functions (FIBFs). Two features from each FIBF are extracted in the second phase, including kurtosis and log energy entropy. The last stage involves passing the features on to various machine learning techniques. The least-square support vector machine (radial basis function) algorithm yielded better classification results with an accuracy of 98.61%, a sensitivity of 98.96%, and a selectivity of 98.26%.",10.1007/s00521-023-09208-2,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1007/s00521-023-09208-2)
WOS,74,Bilateral photoplethysmography for peripheral arterial disease screening in haemodialysis patients using astable multivibrator and machine learning classifier,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is highly prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients with type 2 diabetes. Atherosclerosis may occur in both lower and upper peripheral arteries, causing progressive dialysis access stenosis in HD patients. To assess the risk of PAD, non-invasive bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) can be used to obtain continuous variations in blood flow volume in in vivo examinations. The authors propose an astable multivibrator to model the peripheral circulation system and to produce PPG oscillation with time constants, duty ratio (rising time), and amplitude ratio of systolic and diastolic pressures. Then, the bilateral differences in the time constant and duty ratio are used to separate the normal condition from PAD. The machine learning decision-making process utilises a screening method to automatically detect subjects with and without the risk of PAD. The radial-based function is employed to parameterise the similarity and dissimilarity levels using probability values. Colour relation analysis incorporates the probability values into the perceptual colour relationships for PAD screening. The experimental results indicate that in comparison with bilateral timing parameters, degree of stenosis, and resistive index, the proposed screening method is efficient in preventing complications of PAD and is easily implemented in an embedded system.",10.1049/iet-smt.2018.5330,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1049/iet-smt.2018.5330)
WOS,75,Photoplethysmography and its application in clinical physiological measurement,"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple and low-cost optical technique that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. It is often used non-invasively to make measurements at the skin surface. The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques. The PPG technology has been used in a wide range of commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation, blood pressure and cardiac output, assessing autonomic function and also detecting peripheral vascular disease. The introductory sections of the topical review describe the basic principle of operation and interaction of light with tissue, early and recent history of PPG, instrumentation, measurement protocol, and pulse wave analysis.

To improve the performance of SVM and reduce the noisy data we employed hybrid feature selection technique that reduces the feature set of 37 to 10 on the basis of majority voting. Using 10 selected features set, we gained an accuracy of 97.87%, sensitivity of 98.78% and specificity of 96.61%.

Some hemodynamically based non-invasive video processing applications have been applied for blood pressure classification and blood glucose prediction objectives for unobtrusive physiological monitoring at home. However, this approach is still under development with very few publications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework, entitled cocktail causal container, to fuse multiple physiological representations and to reconstruct the correlation between frequency and temporal information during multi-task learning. Cocktail causal container processes hematologic reflex information to classify blood pressure and blood glucose. Since the learning of discriminative features from video physiological representations is quite challenging, we propose a token feature fusion block to fuse the multi-view fine-grained representations to a union discrete frequency space. A causal net is used to analyze the fused higher-order information, so that the framework can be enforced to disentangle the latent factors into the related endogenous association that corresponds to down-stream fusion information to improve the semantic interpretation. Moreover, a pair-wise temporal frequency map is developed to provide valuable insights into extraction of salient photoplethysmograph (PPG) information from fingertip videos obtained by a standard smart phone camera. Extensive comparisons have been implemented for the validation of cocktail causal container using a Clinical dataset and PPG-BP benchmark.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with the involvement of both small vessels and large vessels. Studies on the relevance of baPWV to early diabetic nephropathy are scarce. This retrospective observational case-control study enrolled 120 patients with type 2 diabetes from our medical records. We classified patients into two groups depending on the magnitude of albuminuria: 60 patients with microalbuminuria were classified as the early diabetic nephropathy group (EDN group) and 60 patients without albuminuria were classified as the diabetes without nephropathy group (DWN group). An additional 30 nondiabetic age- and sex-matched controls were also enrolled. Data regarding the lipid profile, blood pressure, baPWV, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, anthropometric measurements, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), serum creatinine level, and glycemic control indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c)) were recorded for all enrolled participants. baPWV was significantly higher in the EDN group than in the DWN group. Moreover, baPWV was positively correlated with age, duration of diabetes, obesity, poor glycemic control, and high serum levels of triglycerides (TG), hs-CRP, creatinine, and uric acid as well as a high UACR (all P<0.01). A significant negative correlation was found between baPWV and high-density lipoprotein levels (P<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the hs-CRP level and duration of diabetes most strongly influenced baPWV. baPWV may be a convenient, noninvasive, and reproducible method for detecting early diabetic nephropathy.",10.1155/2021/8862573,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1155/2021/8862573)

Between July 2009 and October 2010, totally 94 middle-aged and elderly subjects were recruited including 48 without diabetes (Group 1) and 46 with the disease (Group 2). Demographic (i. e., age, gender), anthropometric (body-mass index), biochemical (i. e., glycated hemoglobin concentration), and hemodynamic (i. e., systolic blood pressure, heart rate) parameters were obtained. Crest time (CT) and crest time ratio (CTR) computed from PPG signals acquired from left index finger were compared with left index finger pulse wave velocity (PWVfinger) obtained from six-channel ECGPWV system to investigate the differences between the two groups and the associations of these indices with the parameters of testing subjects. Significant difference was only noted in CTR between the two groups (P < 0.005). Despite correlation of both CTand CTR with age, only CTR demonstrated significant associations with hemodynamic parameters. CTR could differentiate diabetic patients from healthy individuals despite absence of difference in arterial stiffness assessed by conventional PWV, highlighting its superior sensitivity to subtle changes in diabetes-associated arteriosclerosis.",10.1007/s10916-018-0901-1,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1007/s10916-018-0901-1)

We proposed an easily operable air pressure sensing system (APSS) for radial arterial signal capturing. Totally, 108 subjects (young, the aged with or without diabetes) were recruited from July 2009 to May 2010. Arterial waveform signals from the wrist were obtained and analyzed using Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT). Through ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the signals were decomposed into eight intrinsic mode functions (IMF1-8) of which IMF5 was found to be the desired signal with a discernible diastolic peak. The results showed significant differences in reflection index (RI) and stiffness index (SI) from the young subjects and those from the aged participants with or without diabetes. Significant differences in RI and SI were also noted between subjects with well-controlled diabetes and those without. Good reproducibility and correlation were demonstrated.

WOS,83,Non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose using optical methods for skin spectroscopyopportunities and recent advances,"Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease with greatly rising patient numbers expectedin the future, not only for industrialized countries but also for regions in the developing world. There is aneed for efficient therapy, which can be via self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to provide tight glycemic control for reducing the risks of severe health complications. Advancements in diabetes technology can nowadays offer different sensor approaches, even for continuous blood glucose monitoring. Non-invasive blood glucose assays have been promised for many years and various vibrational spectroscopy-based methods of theskin are candidates for achieving this goal. Due to the small spectral signatures of the glucose hidden among a largely variable background, the largest signal-to-noise ratios and multivariate calibration are essential to provide the method applicability for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Besides multiparameter approaches, recently presented devices based on photoplethysmography with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared range are evaluated for their potential of providing reliable blood glucose concentration predictions.",10.1007/s00216-018-1395-x,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1007/s00216-018-1395-x)
WOS,84,Photoplethysmography Analysis with Duffing-Holmes Self-Synchronization Dynamic Errors and 1D CNN-Based Classifier for Upper Extremity Vascular Disease Screening,"Common upper limb peripheral artery diseases (PADs) are atherosclerosis, embolic diseases, and systemic diseases, which are often asymptomatic, and the narrowed arteries (stenosis) will gradually reduce blood flow in the right or left upper limbs. Upper extremity vascular disease (UEVD) and atherosclerosis are high-risk PADs for patients with Type 2 diabetes or with both diabetes and end-stage renal disease. For early UEVD detection, a fingertip-based, toe-based, or wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) tool is a simple and noninvasive measurement system for vital sign monitoring and healthcare applications. Based on time-domain PPG analysis, a Duffing-Holmes system with a master system and a slave system is used to extract self-synchronization dynamic errors, which can track the differences in PPG morphology (in amplitudes (systolic peak) and time delay (systolic peak to diastolic peak)) between healthy subjects and PAD patients. In the preliminary analysis, the self-synchronization dynamic errors can be used to evaluate risk levels based on the reflection index (RI), which includes normal condition, lower PAD, and higher PAD. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is established as a multilayer classifier for automatic UEVD screening. The experimental results indicated that the self-synchronization dynamic errors have a positive correlation with the RI (R-2 = 0.6694). The K-fold cross-validation is used to verify the performance of the proposed classifier with recall (%), precision (%), accuracy (%), and F-1 score.",10.3390/pr9112093,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/pr9112093)
WOS,86,Noninvasive Evaluation of Endothelial Activity in Healthy and Diseased Individuals,"Background: Diminished endothelial activity (EA) has been associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CAD) events. Methods: Vasodilatory responses (EA and relative distensibility [RD]) were evaluated noninvasively using iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACH) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and recorded by laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) and photoplethysmography (PPG) among 324 patients. Results: The EA after ACH iontophoresis measured by LDF was significantly higher in the younger (<50 years) group than in the older (>50 years) group, 125.4 versus 103.3 integrated arbitrary unit (P < .005). Compared to the older patients, the EA values recorded by LDF were significantly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus (64.9), hypercholesterolemia (83.3), hypertension (88.7), CAD (61.0), and peripheral artery disease (67.4). The findings of RD were similar. Conclusions: The results indicate that measuring EA using the iontophoresis of ACH or SNP and combined with either LDF or PPG is a viable approach that can discriminate between different clinical groups.",10.1177/1538574413508229,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1177/1538574413508229)
WOS,87,A dynamic spectrum optimized single-trail extraction method for noninvasive analysis of human blood components,"Dynamic spectroscopy (DS) is a new noninvasive detection method of human blood components. Theoretically, it can eliminate the individual differences of static tissues such as skin and muscle and the influence of measurement conditions on measurement accuracy, and realize high-precision noninvasive blood component analysis. Obtaining the dynamic spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio is the key to modeling and analysis. To further improve the quality of the dynamic spectrum and ensure the robustness of the model, this paper proposes an optimized single-trail extraction method, which is improved for the main single-trail extraction method at present. In this method, the sampling points deviating from the fitting line in the rising edge signal of photo-plethysmography (PPG) are eliminated by statistical method many times and using the superposition average of the slope between each sampling point on the rising edge to obtain the high-quality DS. To verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, we collected the spectral PPG data of the near-infrared trans-mission of the fingers of 231 volunteers, the wavelength range was 591.8 nm-1100 nm, and the hemoglobin concentration range of the total sample was 90-176 g / L, then used the optimized single-trail extraction method and the single-trail extraction method to extract DS from the spectral PPG data of all samples and divided them into an experimental group and a control group according to the different extraction methods. Two methods of spectral smoothness and modeling analysis were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the spectrum. The experimental data are as follows: when the DS is evaluated with spectral smoothness as an index, the mean square error of the experimental group's spectrum is reduced from 0.011 to 0.0059, which is 53.6 % of the control group; and when using the least partial squares method to establish a hemoglobin model for prediction, compared with the control group, the related coefficient of the correction set (Rc) in the experimental group reached 0.91, an increase of 7.96 %, and the root mean square error of the correction set (RMSEC) of the calibration set decreased to 5.63g/L, decreased by 22.17 %, the related coefficient of the prediction set (Rp) reached 0.86, increased by 10.90 %, and the root mean square error of the prediction set (RMSEP) decreased to 6.27g/L, decreased by 19.76 %. The experimental results show that the optimized single-trail extraction method proposed in this paper improves the spectral smoothness and modeling effect compared with the original single -trail extraction method effectively improving the quality of DS. This method provides a new way for further improving the accuracy of noninvasive blood component quantitative analysis based on dynamic spectrum and helps to promote the application process of noninvasive detection of blood components.",10.1016/j.infrared.2022.104358,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,88,The Effectiveness of Wearable Devices Using Artificial Intelligence for Blood Glucose Level Forecasting or Prediction: Systematic Review,"Background: In 2021 alone, diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disorder primarily characterized by abnormally high blood glucose (BG) levels, affected 537 million people globally, and over 6 million deaths were reported. The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions: This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.",10.2196/40259,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.2196/40259)
WOS,89,RETRACTED: Optimization and Evaluation of an Intelligent Short-Term Blood Glucose Prediction Model Based on Noninvasive Monitoring and Deep Learning Techniques (Retracted Article),"Continuous noninvasive blood glucose monitoring and estimation management by using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology always have a series of problems, such as substantial time variability, inaccuracy, and complex nonlinearity. This paper proposes a blood glucose (BG) prediction model for more precise prediction based on BG series decomposition by complete aggregation empirical mode decomposition based on adaptive white noise (CEEMDAN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) that is optimized by improved bacterial foraging optimization (IBFO). Hierarchical clustering technology recombines the decomposed BG series according to their sample entropy and the correlations with the original BG trends. Dynamic BG trends are regressed separately for each recombined BG series by the GRU model to realize the more precise estimations, which are optimized by IBFO for its structure and superparameters. Through experiments, the optimized and basic LSTM, RNN, and support vector regression (SVR) are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the 15-min IBFO-GRU prediction is improved on average by about 13.1% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with those of the RNN and LSTM optimized by IBFO. Meanwhile, the proposed model improved the Clarke error grid results by about 2.6% and 5.0% compared with those of the IBFO-LSTM and IBFO-RNN in 30-min prediction and by 4.1% and 6.6% in 15-min ahead forecast, respectively. The evaluation outcomes of our proposed CEEMDAN-IBFO-GRU model have high accuracy and adaptability and can effectively provide early intervention control of the occurrence of hyperglycemic complications.",10.1155/2022/8956850,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1155/2022/8956850)
WOS,90,Oxidative stress could precede endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians with impaired glucose metabolism,"Aims/hypothesis. To measure oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians at different stages of development of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. Plasma total 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), an indicator of oxidative stress, was determined in age-matched subjects with normal glucose metabolism (n = 39), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 14), newly diagnosed diabetes (n = a) and established diabetes (n = 14). Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and 2 h following an oral glucose tolerance test. Endothelial function was assessed by non-invasive digital pulse wave photoplethysmography. Results. Plasma 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) increased in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) compared with control subjects, and was even higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.01) diabetic patients. A tendency towards reduced endothelial function in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance became significant in patients with newly diagnosed and established diabetes (p < 0.01), and was correlated with 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) (r=0.36, p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) did not change in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with control subjects, but increased in newly diagnosed (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.001) diabetic subjects. The 8-epi-PGF(2) was correlated with fasting glucose (r = 0.50, p < 0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Conclusion/interpretation.

WOS,91,Non-invasive blood glucose detection system based on conservation of energy method,"The most common method used for minimizing the occurrence of diabetes complications is frequent glucose testing to adjust the insulin dose. However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservationof- energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples. Thus, this system demonstrates a great potential to reliably detect BG values in a non-invasive setting.",10.1088/1361-6579/aa50cf,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1088/1361-6579/aa50cf)
WOS,92,Noninvasive In Vivo Estimation of HbA1c Based on the Beer-Lambert Model from Photoplethysmogram Using Only Two Wavelengths,"Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the most important factor in diabetes control. Since HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding three months, it is unaffected by a patient's activity level or diet before a test. Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complications associated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography is helpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths (615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two different ratio calibrations were applied and their performances were compared to a work that used three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson's r values for HbA1c estimates were 0.896 and 0.905, considering the ratio calibrations for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibration in addition to the ratio calibrations, we could improve this performance such that the Pearson's r values of the HbA1c levels were 0.929 and 0.930 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. In a previous study, using three wavelengths, the Pearson's r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Here, the RCF of the SpO(2) estimation was 0.986 when the SpO(2) ratio calibration was applied, while in a previous study, the RCF values of the SpO(2) estimation were 0.983 and 0.986 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Thus, we have shown that HbA1c estimation using only two wavelengths has a comparable performance to previous studies.",10.3390/app13063626,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/app13063626)
WOS,93,Overview of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Wearable Devices for Diabetes: Scoping Review,"Background: Prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased over the last few decades with 1.5 million deaths reported in 2012 alone. Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective: This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results: From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions: This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain.

WOS,94,Quantitative analysis of human blood glucose by dynamic optical rotation angle of multiple wavelengths based on the polarization camera,"Measurement of blood glucose concentration is important in the prevention and treatment of diabetes. To improve the measurement signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy, using a polarization camera as the sensor, this paper proposes a multi-wavelength dynamic optical rotation angle method to quantitatively analyze human blood glucose. First, this paper utilizes a split-time approach to drive nine different wavelengths of light sources to work separately to achieve the collection of multiple different wavelengths of data and increase the amount of information. Second, to capture images with an array sensor such as a camera, using space-for-accuracy, this paper uses the cumulative value of the gray values of all pixel points in the image at each angle as the light intensity value to improve the amplitude (light intensity) resolution. Third, the extraction method of the dynamic optical rotation angle in this paper is to extract the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the optical rotation angle from each cycle of the signal of the continuous cyclic change of the length of the optical path, and the accumulated value of the difference of multiple cycles is recorded as the dynamic optical rotation angle, which not only reduces the errors caused by the individual differences, the external environment and the measuring instrument, but also has the effect of averaging and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical rotation angle. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, human finger real and simulation experiments are carried out, respectively. Firstly, the polarization camera is used to collect the image data of elliptically polarized light of nine different wavelengths of linearly polarized light after passing through the human body's finger, and obtains the optical rotation angle under each wavelength that changes with the photoplethysmography (PPG) through data processing, and extracts the dynamic optical rotation angles of the nine wavelengths by the extraction method, and the human body's blood glucose can be quantitatively analyzed. Secondly, this paper builds a simulation model to simulate the blood volume conversion of the human finger, and uses the simulation experimental system to collect the dynamic optical rotation angles of nine wavelengths of a total of 137 human serum samples, and uses partial least squares regression to establish a model between the dynamic optical rotation angles and blood glucose concentration. In the results of predicting all samples using the model, the correlation coefficient and root mean square error were 0.7960 and 2.16 mmol/L, respectively, both of which improved by 137.26% and decreased by 35.33 %, respectively, compared to the existing method. The experimental results show that the method in this paper has high accuracy in detecting the blood glucose concentration in human beings, which is of great significance in realizing the noninvasive quantitative analysis of human blood glucose components by the polarized light method.",10.1016/j.measurement.2024.116008,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.measurement.2024.116008)

While the former shows better predictability of baseline glucose levels, it lacks sensitivity to daily fluctuations. Near-infrared methods respond well to short-term changes but face challenges due to individual and environmental factors. To address this, we developed a novel fingertip blood glucose detection system combining both methods. Using multiple light sensors and a lightweight deep learning model, our system achieved promising results in oral glucose tolerance tests. A total of 10 participants were involved in the study, each providing approximately 700 data segments of about 10 seconds each.

The screening system consists of two parts: the first analyzes the signal obtained from the pulse oximeter, and the second consists of a machine-learning module. The system consists of a front end that extracts a set of features form the pulse oximeter signal. These features are based on physiological considerations. The set of features were the input of a machine-learning algorithm that determined the class of the input sample, i.e., whether the subject had diabetes or not. The machine-learning algorithms were random forests, gradient boosting, and linear discriminant analysis as benchmark. The system was tested on a database of 1157 subjects (two samples per subject) collected from five community health centers. The mean receiver operating characteristic area found was 69.4% (median value 71.9% and range [75.4-61.1%]), with a specificity = 64% for a threshold that gave a sensitivity = 65%.

WOS,98,Dynamic analysis with a fractional-order chaotic system for estimation of peripheral arterial disease in diabetic foot,"Lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is caused by narrowing or occlusion of vessels in patients like type 2 diabetes mellitus, the elderly and smokers. Patients with PAD are mostly asymptomatic; typical early symptoms of this limb-threatening disorder are intermittent claudication and leg pain, suggesting the necessity for accurate diagnosis by invasive angiography and ankle-brachial pressure index. This index acts as a gold standard reference for PAD diagnosis and categorizes its severity into normal, low-grade and high-grade, with respective cut-off points of >= 0.9, 0.9-0.5 and <0.5. PAD can be assessed using photoplethysmography as a diagnostic screening tool, displaying changes in pulse transit time and shape, and dissimilarities of these changes between lower limbs. The present report proposed photoplethysmogram with fractional-order chaotic system to assess PAD in 14 diabetics and 11 healthy adults, with analysis of dynamic errors based on various butterfly motion patterns, and color relational analysis as classifier for pattern recognition. The results show that the classification of PAD severity among these testees was achieved with high accuracy and efficiency.

WOS,100,Blood glucose prediction based on imagingphotoplethysmography in combination with Machine learning,"At present, the mainstream blood glucose detection methods are invasive, which will cause harm to the human body and make it inconvenient to measure. The non-contact measurement method can avoid these problems. In this paper, a non-contact blood glucose detection method based on a near-infrared camera is proposed. Blood glucose has a strong absorption capacity in the near-infrared band, and other components in blood (water, he-moglobin, etc.) have different absorption characteristics in this band compared with blood glucose. Therefore, in this method, we realize blood glucose detection by receiving the near-infrared light reflected back after blood glucose absorption. We extracted 26 pulse wave features from the pulse wave and analyzed 6 that were highly correlated with blood glucose. Then, four kinds of machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLS, SVR, RFR) were used to build models respectively, and the RFR with the best performance was selected to build the final blood glucose prediction model. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed by Clark error grid analysis, which shows that the proposed method is in good agreement with the reference glucose monitor.

Those devices are very similar in their analog front end circuit which is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). Many different TIA topologies have appeared in different optoelectronic fields which make the choice of the best TIA topology for a certain application a challenging task.

The topologies are simulated with 10 pF photodiode (PD) input capacitance and 5 KHz bandwidth (BW) while optimizing for two different targets; one time for minimum input noise and the other for minimum power consumption. Moreover, the same procedures are performed with 2 pF PD and 100 MHz BW to account for higher BW demanding applications. The studied topologies are compared according to their transimpedance gain, power consumption, total input referred noise current, and dynamic range (DR) to expose their relative merits.

WOS,102,Non-invasive blood glucose estimation method based on the phase delay between oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy,"Significance Many researchers have attempted to estimate blood glucose levels (BGLs) noninvasively using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. However, the optical absorption change induced by blood glucose is weak in the NIR region and often masked by interference from other components such as water and hemoglobin. Aim Instead of using direct optical absorption by glucose, this study proposes an index calculated from oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals that shows a good correlation with BGLs while using conventional visible and NIR spectroscopy. Approach The metabolic index, which is based on tissue oxygen consumption, was derived through analytical methods and further verified and reproduced in a series of glucose challenge experiments. Blood glucose estimation units were prototyped by utilizing commercially available smart devices. Results Our experimental results showed that the phase delay between the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals in near-infrared spectroscopy correlates with BGL measured by a conventional continuous glucose monitor. The proposed method was also confirmed to work well with visible spectroscopy systems based on smartphone cameras. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent repeatability in results from a total of 19 oral challenge tests. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of non-invasive glucose monitoring using existing photoplethysmography sensors for pulse oximeters and smartwatches. Evaluating the proposed method in diabetic or unhealthy individuals may serve to further increase its practicality. (c) The Authors.

To overcome these long-standing problems, we largely enhanced the training efficiency with the limited personal data by an innovative Deduction Learning (DL), instead of the conventional Induction Learning (IL). The domain theory of our deductive method, DL, made use of accumulated comparison of paired inputs leading to corrections to preceded measured blood glucose to construct our deep neural network architecture. DL method involves the use of paired adjacent rounds of finger pulsation Photoplethysmography signal recordings as the input to a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) based deep learning model. Our study reveals that CNN filters of DL model generated extra and non-uniform feature patterns than that of IL models, which suggests DL is superior to IL in terms of learning efficiency under limited training data. Among 30 diabetic patients as our recruited volunteers, DL model achieved 80% of test prediction in zone A of Clarke Error Grid (CEG) for model training with 12 rounds of data, which was 20% improvement over IL method. Furthermore, we developed an automatic screening algorithm to delete low confidence outlier predictions. With only a dozen rounds of training data, DL with automatic screening achieved a correlation coefficient (R-P) of 0.81, an accuracy score (R-A) of 93.5, a root mean squared error of 13.93 mg/dl, a mean absolute error of 12.07 mg/dl, and 100% predictions in zone A of CEG. The nonparametric Wilcoxon paired test on R-A for DL versus IL revealed near significant difference with p-value 0.06. These significant improvements indicate that a very simple and precise noninvasive measurement of blood glucose concentration is achievable.",10.1038/s41598-022-10360-3,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1038/s41598-022-10360-3)
WOS,105,Difference in bilateral digital volume pulse as a novel non-invasive approach to assessing arteriosclerosis in aged and diabetic subjects: A preliminary study,"Objective: This study aimed at validating photoplethysmography for assessing bilateral blood pressure differences through investigating the correlations of digital volume pulse with arteriosclerosis risk. Methods: Totally, 111 subjects (70 healthy and 41 diabetic) were recruited. Demographic, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. Blood was collected for determining serum cholesterol, total triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. Arterial stiffness was assessed with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, crest time and inter-digital volume pulse differences. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated high inter-digital volume pulse difference sensitivity to glycated haemoglobin level over 6.5%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated significant correlation between inter-digital volume pulse difference and electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity (r=0.692, p<0.001). Compared with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, inter-digital volume pulse difference exhibited highly significant correlations with age, glycated haemoglobin level, pulse pressure, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, crest time, high-density lipoprotein and systolic blood pressure (all ps<0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated successful application of a novel non-invasive waveform contour index, inter-digital volume pulse difference, in differentiating young from aged subjects and patients with good diabetic control from those with poor diabetic control but also validated its use in identifying arteriosclerosis risks. The results, therefore, endorse its domestic application as non-invasive tool for arteriosclerosis risk screening.",10.1177/1479164116688870,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1177/1479164116688870)
WOS,106,Joint quaternion valued features and quaternion valued long short term memory based recurrent neural network for non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"For the four channel photoplethysmograms (PPGs), this paper proposes a quaternion valued based method for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. First, these four channel PPGs form a quaternion valued signal. Then, the quaternion valued means and the quaternion valued medians of this quaternion valued PPGs are employed as features. Next, the quaternion valued long short term memory (QLSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed for estimating the non-invasive blood glucose values. Unlike the traditional methods based on extracting the features in each channel of the PPGs independently and fusing all the features together in the conventional neural networks, the quaternion valued operations performed on the quaternion valued PPGs only fuse the same features among these four channels together while do not fuse different features among these four channels together. Hence, the physical interpretations of the features preserve. To demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed method, two datasets are evaluated. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can yield 81.43% and 83.09% of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clark error grid for the test data in the first dataset and in the second dataset, respectively. Also, it can yield the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) at 14.41% and 14.31% for the test data in the first dataset and the second dataset, respectively. This demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method over the existing methods for the test data in the both datasets.",10.1016/j.bspc.2024.107267,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1016/j.bspc.2024.107267)
WOS,107,Small intra-individual variability of the pre-ejection period justifies the use of pulse transit time as approximation of the vascular transit,"Background Vascular transit time (VTT) is the propagation time of a pulse wave through an artery; it is a measure for arterial stiffness. Because reliable non-invasive VTT measurements are difficult, as an alternative we measure pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is defined as the time between the R-wave on electrocardiogram and arrival of the resulting pulse wave in a distal location measured with photoplethysmography (PPG). The time between electrical activation of the ventricles and the resulting pulse wave after opening of the aortic valve is called the pre-ejection period (PEP), a component of PTT. The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of PEP at rest, to establish how accurate PTT is as approximation of VTT. Methods PTT was measured and PEP was assessed with echocardiography (gold standard) in three groups of 20 volunteers: 1) a control group without cardiovascular disease aged <50 years and 2) aged >50 years, and 3) a group with cardiovascular risk factors, defined as arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, kidney failure and diabetes mellitus. Results Per group, the mean PEP was: 1) 58.5 +/- 13.0 ms, 2) 52.4 +/- 11.9 ms, and 3) 57.6 +/- 11.6 ms. However, per individual the standard deviation was much smaller, i.e. 1) 2.0-5.9 ms, 2) 2.85.1 ms, and 3) 1.6-12.0 ms, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean PEP of the 3 groups (p = 0.236). Conclusion In conclusion, the intra-individual variability of PEP is small. A change in PTT in a person at rest is most probably the result of a change in VTT rather than of PEP. Thus, PTT at rest is an easy, non-invasive and accurate approximation of VTT for monitoring arterial stiffness.",10.1371/journal.pone.0204105,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204105)
WOS,108,A digital biomarker of diabetes from smartphone-based vascular signals,"The global burden of diabetes is rapidly increasing, from 451 million people in 2019 to 693 million by 2045(1). The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity(2). Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the 'primary cohort'), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the 'contemporary cohort') and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the 'clinic cohort'). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750-0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P <= 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes. A deep neural network applied to smartphone-based vascular imaging can detect diabetes, opening new possibilities for non-invasive diagnosis.",10.1038/s41591-020-1010-5,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1038/s41591-020-1010-5)
WOS,109,Fusion of various optimisation based feature smoothing methods for wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"The traditional blood glucose estimation method requires to take the invasive measurements several times a day. Therefore, it has a high infection risk and the users are suffered from the pain. Moreover, the long term consumable cost is high. Recently, the wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation approach has been proposed. However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the presence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the obtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable. Moreover, different subjects have different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose. To address this issue, a polynomial fitting approach to smooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values has been proposed. In particular, the design of the coefficients in the polynomial is formulated as the various optimisation problems. First, the blood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimisation approaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood glucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimisation approach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each optimisation approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each sorted blood glucose value, the optimisation method corresponding to the minimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate probability of each selected optimisation method is computed. If the accumulate probability of any selected optimisation method at a point is greater than a threshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected optimisation methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted blood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries points being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after performing the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose values in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose values and the corresponding optimisation methods in these regions are determined. It is worth noting that the conventional lowpass denoising method was performed in the signal domain (either in the time domain or in the frequency domain), while the authors' proposed method is performed in the feature space or the reference blood glucose space. Hence, the authors' proposed method can further improve the reliability of the obtained feature values or the reference blood glucose values so as to improve the accuracy of the blood glucose estimation. Moreover, the individual modelling regression method has been employed here to suppress the effects of different users having different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose values. The computer numerical simulation results show that the authors' proposed method yields the mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) at 0.0930 and the percentage of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid at 94.1176%.",10.1049/syb2.12063,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1049/syb2.12063)
WOS,110,Derivation and validation of gray-box models to estimate noninvasive in-vivo percentage glycated hemoglobin using digital volume pulse waveform,"Glycated hemoglobin and blood oxygenation are the two most important factors for monitoring a patient's average blood glucose and blood oxygen levels. Digital volume pulse acquisition is a convenient method, even for a person with no previous training or experience, can be utilized to estimate the two abovementioned physiological parameters. The physiological basis assumptions are utilized to develop two-finger models for estimating the percent glycated hemoglobin and blood oxygenation levels. The first model consists of a blood-vessel-only hypothesis, whereas the second model is based on a whole-finger model system. The two gray-box systems were validated on diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The mean absolute errors for the percent glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1c) and percent oxygen saturation (%SpO(2)) were 0.375 and 1.676 for the blood-vessel model and 0.271 and 1.395 for the whole-finger model, respectively. The repeatability analysis indicated that these models resulted in a mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) of 2.08% and 1.74% for %HbA1c and 0.54% and 0.49% for %SpO(2) in the respective models. Herein, both models exhibited similar performances (HbA1c estimation Pearson's R values were 0.92 and 0.96, respectively), despite the model assumptions differing greatly. The bias values in the Bland-Altman analysis for both models were - 0.03 +/- 0.458 and - 0.063 +/- 0.326 for HbA1c estimation, and 0.178 +/- 2.002 and - 0.246 +/- 1.69 for SpO2 estimation, respectively. Both models have a very high potential for use in real-world scenarios. The whole-finger model with a lower standard deviation in bias and higher Pearson's R value performs better in terms of higher precision and accuracy than the blood-vessel model.",10.1038/s41598-021-91527-2,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,111,Non-invasive detection of early microvascular changes in juveniles with type 1 diabetes,"Aims/HypothesisThe study aimed to assess the usefulness of capillaroscopy and photoplethysmography in the search for early vascular anomalies in children with type 1 diabetes.MethodsOne hundred sixty children and adolescents aged 6-18, 125 patients with type 1 diabetes, and 35 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. We performed a detailed clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, nailfold capillaroscopy, and photoplethysmography.ResultsPatients with diabetes had more often abnormal morphology in capillaroscopy (68.60%, p = 0.019), enlarged capillaries (32.6%, p = 0.006), and more often more over five meandering capillaries (20.90%, p = 0.026) compared to healthy controls. Meandering capillaries correlated with higher parameters of nutritional status. In a photoplethysmography, patients with diagnosed neuropathy had a higher percentage of flow disturbance curves (p < 0.001) with a reduced frequency of normal curves (p = 0.050).ConclusionsCapillaroscopic and photoplethysmographic examinations are non-invasive, painless, fast, and inexpensive. They are devoid of side effects, and there are no limitations in the frequency of their use and repetition. The usefulness of capillaroscopy and photoplethysmography in the study of microcirculation in diabetic patients indicates the vast application possibilities of these methods in clinical practice.",10.1186/s12933-023-02031-y,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1186/s12933-023-02031-y)
WOS,112,Recent Advances in Wearable Optical Sensor Automation Powered by Battery versus Skin-like Battery-Free Devices for Personal Healthcare-A Review,"Currently, old-style personal Medicare techniques rely mostly on traditional methods, such as cumbersome tools and complicated processes, which can be time consuming and inconvenient in some circumstances. Furthermore, such old methods need the use of heavy equipment, blood draws, and traditional bench-top testing procedures. Invasive ways of acquiring test samples can potentially cause patient discomfort and anguish. Wearable sensors, on the other hand, may be attached to numerous body areas to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics as a developing analytical tool. Physical, chemical, and biological data transferred via the skin are used to monitor health in various circumstances. Wearable sensors can assess the aberrant conditions of the physical or chemical components of the human body in real time, exposing the body state in time, thanks to unintrusive sampling and high accuracy. Most commercially available wearable gadgets are mechanically hard components attached to bands and worn on the wrist, with form factors ultimately constrained by the size and weight of the batteries required for the power supply. Basic physiological signals comprise a lot of health-related data. The estimation of critical physiological characteristics, such as pulse inconstancy or variability using photoplethysmography (PPG) and oxygen saturation in arterial blood using pulse oximetry, is possible by utilizing an analysis of the pulsatile component of the bloodstream. Wearable gadgets with skin-like qualities are a new type of automation that is only starting to make its way out of research labs and into pre-commercial prototypes. Flexible skin-like sensing devices have accomplished several functionalities previously inaccessible for typical sensing devices due to their deformability, lightness, portability, and flexibility. In this paper, we studied the recent advancement in battery-powered wearable sensors established on optical phenomena and skin-like battery-free sensors, which brings a breakthrough in wearable sensing automation.",10.3390/nano12030334,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/nano12030334)
WOS,113,Measurement of stiffness index by digital volume pulse analysis technique: Clinical utility in cardiovascular disease risk stratification,"BACKGROUND Indices of arterial stiffness are accepted as independent markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD), having both positive prognostic and diagnostic implications. The utility of stiffness index (SI) derived from digital volume pulse (DVP) analysis in CVD risk screening is not established. METHODS Using a representative sample of individuals from local communities (West Midlands, UK), we determined the performance of SI in the discrimination of increasing CVD risk. Arterial stiffness was measured by DVP photoplethysmography (PCA 2; Micro Medical) using a direct, standardized approach. CVD risk assessment was performed in accordance with the Joint British Society guidelines (JBS2). RESULTS Of our cohort of 247 individuals (51% male; mean age 55.2 (s.d. 10.3) years), 187 were apparently healthy and 60 had established CVD risk factors (diabetes mellitus:33%, hypertension: 77.8%, hypercholesteremia: 61%). On univariate analysis, Sl was strongly associated with CVD risk (the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) based HeartScore) (Pearson correlation coefficient (R): 0.56, P <= 0.001) and increased in an ordinal fashion from low risk to medium risk to high risk to very high risk (pseudo R-2 = 0.30; P < 0.001). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, Sl was the best discriminator between low to medium risk and high-risk categories (area under curve (AUC): 0.76 (95% Cl 0.64-0.88), P < 0.001) when compared to total cholesterol, plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio and had the utility to discriminate the individuals with known CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. CONCLUSION Noninvasive measurements of arterial stiffness may aid the optimal stratification of CVD risk in an apparently healthy population.",10.1038/ajh.2008.207,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1038/ajh.2008.207)
WOS,114,Integrated non-invasive biochemical and biophysical sensing systems for health and performance monitoring: A systems perspective,"Advances in materials, bio-recognition elements, transducers, and microfabrication techniques, as well as progress in electronics, signal processing, and wireless communication have generated a new class of skininterfaced wearable health monitoring systems for applications in personalized medicine and digital health. In comparison to conventional medical devices, these wearable systems are at the cusp of initiating a new era of longitudinal and noninvasive sensing for the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases at the molecular level. Herein, we provide a review of recent developments in wearable biochemical and biophysical systems. We survey the sweat sampling and collection methods for biochemical systems, followed by an assessment of biochemical and biophysical sensors deployed in current wearable systems with an emphasis on their hardware specifications. Specifically, we address how sweat collection and sample handling platforms may be a rate limiting technology to realizing the clinical translation of wearable health monitoring systems; moreover, we highlight the importance of achieving both longitudinal sensing and assessment of intrapersonal variation in sweat-blood correlations to have the greatest clinical impact. Lastly, we assess a snapshot of integrated wireless wearable systems with multimodal sensing capabilities, and we conclude with our perspective on the state-of-the-art and the required developments to achieve the next-generation of integrated wearable health and performance monitoring systems.",10.1016/j.bios.2021.113249,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,115,A noninvasive measure of baroreflex sensitivity without blood pressure measurement,"Background Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV) are attenuated in cardiovascular disease and can give important prognostic information. Conventional measures of BRS require expensive or invasive equipment for the beat-to-beat measure of blood pressure (BP). We examined the possibility of developing a simple protocol that would provide a relatively standardized BP stimulus, which might obviate the need to measure BP beat-by-beat. Methods and Results Fifty-five patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 59 [SD 11] years) and 20 healthy control subjects (mean age 53 [SD 14] years, P not significant) underwent 5-minute recordings of BP (by photoplethysmograph) and R-R interval during 0.1.Hz controlled breathing. The size of the oscillations in BP was the same in the 2 groups (3.6 mm Hg vs 4.1 mm Hg, P = .5). There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations (77 ms vs 3 1 ms, P < .000 1). The amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations correlated strongly with BRS (r = 0.8 1, P < .000 1 with controlled breathing BRS, and r = 0.51, P < .0001 with (x index). There was no correlation with the size of BP oscillations (r = -0.13, P not significant with controlled breathing BRS, and r = -0.15, P not significant with alpha index). In a separate study, a group of 22 young patients (mean age 36 years) with type I diabetes mellitus and 28 healthy control subjects (mean age 39 years) underwent measurement of resting HRV and amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during 0.1.Hz breathing. There was no significant difference in triangular index or low-frequency R-R interval power between the 2 groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during controlled breathing between patients with diabetes and healthy control subjects. Total and high-frequency RR interval variability was also significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion During 0.1.Hz breathing, the marked difference in BRS between patients with CHF and age-matched control subjects is the result of smaller R-R interval oscillations. In young patients with diabetes, these R-R interval oscillations are significantly smaller than age-matched control subjects, even when some measures of spontaneous HRV are not different between groups. Breathing at 0.1.Hz provides a standard BP stimulus and concentrates spectral power of heart rate at one frequency, enabling simple evaluation of BRS even when BP measurement is not available.",10.1067/mhj.2002.121263,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1067/mhj.2002.121263)
WOS,116,Skin perfusion pressure of the foot is a good substitute for toe pressure in the assessment of limb ischemia,"Purpose: Noninvasive measurements of limb systolic pressures are used routinely in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease, including the evaluation for critical Limb ischemia. However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skill perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured. Methods: Measurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning. Results: There was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P < .01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P < .01 in both cases). Conclusions: We concluded that SPP measured in the foot correlates well with toe pressure and can be substituted for toe pressure measurement in patients in whom toe pressures cannot be measured.",10.1067/mva.2000.107310,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1067/mva.2000.107310)
WOS,117,A wearable diffuse reflectance sensor for continuous monitoring of cutaneous blood content,"An optical diffuse reflectance sensor for characterization of cutaneous blood content and optimized for continuous monitoring has been developed as part of a non-invasive multisensor system for glucose monitoring. A Monte Carlo simulation of the light propagation in the multilayered skin model has been performed in order to estimate the optimal geometrical separation of the light source and detector for skin and underlying tissue. We have observed that the pathlength within the upper vascular plexus of the skin which defines the sensor sensitivity initially grows with increasing source-detector distance (SDD) before reaching a maximum at 3.5 mm and starts to decay with further increase. At the same time, for distances above 2.4 mm, the sensor becomes sensitive to muscle blood content, which decreases the specificity to skin perfusion monitoring. Thus, the SDDs in the range from 1.5 mm to 2.4 mm satisfy the requirements of sensor sensitivity and specificity. The hardware implementation of the system has been realized and tested in laboratory experiments with a venous occlusion procedure and in an outpatient clinical study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. For both testing procedures, the optical sensor demonstrated high sensitivity to perfusion change provoking events. The general build-up of cutaneous blood under the sensor has been observed which can be associated with pressure-induced vasodilation as a response to the sensor application.",10.1088/0031-9155/54/17/015,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,120,Time Frequency Analysis-Based Averaging and Fusion of Features for Wearable Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Estimation,"This paper proposes a feature averaging method based on the fusion of three classical time frequency analysis techniques, namely the discrete cosine transform (DCT), the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based techniques, to reduce the measurement errors. Since different techniques can eliminate different inherent problems of the unreliable features, this paper proposes an improved stacking fusion strategy to fuse these three feature averaging methods together to perform the blood glucose estimation. Finally, the random forest is employed as the regression model. Two datasets are employed for demonstrating the effectiveness and the robustness of out proposed method. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can yield 90.5882% and 86.8421% of the test data in the first dataset and the second dataset falling in the zone A of the Clark error grid, respectively. Also, it can yield the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) at 11.33% and 9.84% for the data in the first dataset and the second dataset, respectively. Besides, our proposed method outperforms the existing methods for the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) in both datasets.",10.1109/TCE.2023.3278540,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1109/tce.2023.3278540)
WOS,121,Independent determinants of second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram among various cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged men,"The second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) has been used as a non-invasive examination for arterial stiffness. The present study sought to elucidate independent determinants of the SDPTG among various cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Japanese men. The SDPTG was obtained from the cuticle of the left-hand forefinger in 973 male workers (mean age: 44 6 years) during a medical checkup at a company. The SDPTG indices (b/a and d/a) were calculated from the height of the wave components. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the independent determinants of an increased b/a (highest quartile of the b/a) were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval (CI]: 1.09-1.15), hypertension (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.03-2.65), dyslipidemia (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09), impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.16-5.07), and a lack of regular exercise (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.29-3.08). Similarly, independent determinants of a decreased d/a (lowest quartile of the d/a) were age (OR: 1.11 per 1-year increase, 95% CI: 1.08-1.14), hypertension (OR: 3.44, 95% CI: 2.20-5.38), and alcohol intake 6 or 7 days per week (OR: 2.70, 95% CI: 1.80-4.06). No independent association was observed between the SDPTG indices and blood leukocyte count or serum C-reactive protein levels. In conclusion, the SDPTG indices reflect arterial properties affected by several cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Japanese men. The association between inflammation and the SDPTG should be evaluated in further studies.",10.1291/hypres.30.1211,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1291/hypres.30.1211)

It depends on physiological or pathophysiological conditions of the organism. The pathological events like arteriosclerosis or diabetes have a primary effect to the artery elasticity. Hypertension or some heart diseases also influence the pulse wave velocity and resulted in earlier wave reflections. There are several methods of pulse wave measurements based on different principles and depending on the type of measured pulse wave. The evaluation parameters can be assessed from the time domain, derivations, velocity or frequency domain. The main aim of this review article is to offer a recent overview of pulse wave measurement parameters and main results obtained.

WOS,123,Toe-brachial index and toe systolic blood pressure for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease,"Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease in which narrowing of arteries reduces blood flow to the lower limbs. PAD is common; it is estimated to affect 236 million individuals worldwide. Advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and concomitant cardiovascular disease are common factors associated with increased risk of PAD. Complications of PAD can include claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore clinically important to use diagnostic tests that accurately identify PAD. Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression or intervene when indicated. Toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are amongst a suite of non-invasive bedside tests used to detect PAD. Both TBI and TSBP are commonly utilised by a variety of clinicians in different settings, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy is warranted and highly relevant to inform clinical practice. Objectives To (1) estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities. Secondary objectives were to investigate several possible sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including the following: patient group tested (people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with renal disease and general population), type of equipment used, positivity threshold and type of reference standard. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc and DARE databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 27 February 2024. Selection criteria We included diagnostic case-control, cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective studies in which all participants had either a TSBP or TBI measurement plus a validated method of vascular diagnostic imaging for PAD. We needed to be able to cross-tabulate (2 x 2 table) results of the index test and the reference standard to include a study. To be included, study populations had to be adults aged 18 years and over. We included studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Studies had to use TSBP and TBI (also called toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI)), either individually, or in addition to other non-invasive tests as index tests to diagnose PAD in individuals with suspected disease. We included data collected by photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and manual or automated digital equipment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently completed data extraction using a standardised form. We extracted data to populate 2 x 2 contingency tables when available (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Where data were not available to enable statistical analysis, we contacted study authors directly. Two review authors working independently undertook quality assessment using QUADAS-2, with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We incorporated two additional questions into the quality appraisal to aid our understanding of the conduct of studies and make appropriate judgements about risk of bias and applicability. Main results Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. Thirteen of the studies used colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) as a reference standard, two used computed tomography angiography (CTA), one used multi-detector row tomography (MDCT), one used angiography and one used a combination of CDU, CTA and angiography. TBI was investigated in 1927 participants and 2550 limbs. TSBP was investigated in 701 participants, of which 701 limbs had TSBP measured. Studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard. The certainty of evidence according to GRADE for most studies was very low. Authors' conclusions Whilst a small number of diagnostic test accuracy studies have been completed for TBI and TSBP to identify PAD, the overall methodological quality was low, with most studies providing a very low certainty of evidence. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is therefore limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. Future research using robust methods and clear reporting is warranted to comprehensively determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the TBI and TSBP for identification of PAD with greater certainty. However, conducting such research where some of the reference tests are invasive and only clinically indicated in populations with known PAD is challenging.",10.1002/14651858.CD013783.pub2,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1002/14651858.cd013783.pub2)
WOS,124,Advanced Uses of Pulse Oximetry for Monitoring Mechanically Ventilated Patients,"Pulse oximetry is an undisputable standard of care in clinical monitoring. It combines a spectrometer to detect hypoxemia with a plethysmograph for the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. These pulse oximetry capabilities are extremely useful for assessing the respiratory and circulatory status and for monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients. On the one hand, the key spectrography-derived function of pulse oximetry is to evaluate a patient's gas exchange that results from a particular ventilatory treatment by continuously and noninvasively measuring arterial hemoglobin saturation (Spo(2)). This information helps to maintain patients above the hypoxemic levels, leading to appropriate ventilator settings and inspired oxygen fractions. However, whenever higher than normal oxygen fractions are used, Spo(2) can mask existing oxygenation defects in ventilated patients. This limitation, resulting from the S shape of the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve, can be overcome by reducing the oxygen fraction delivered to the patient in a controlled and stepwise manner. This results in a Spo(2)/Fio(2) diagram, which allows a rough characterization of a patient's gas exchange, shunt, and the amount of lung area with a low ventilation/perfusion ratio without the need of blood sampling. On the other hand, the photoplethysmography-derived oximeter function has barely been exploited for the purpose of monitoring hemodynamics in mechanically ventilated patients. The analysis of the photoplethysmography contour provides useful real-time and noninvasive information about the interaction of heart and lungs during positive pressure ventilation. These hemodynamic monitoring capabilities are related to both the assessment of preload dependency mainly by analyzing the breath-by-breath variation of the photoplethysmographic signals and the analysis of arterial impedance, Which examines the changes in the plethysmographic amplitude, contour, and derived indexes. In this article, we present and describe these extended monitoring capabilities and propose a more holistic monitoring concept that takes advantage of these advanced uses of pulse oximetry in the monitoring of ventilated patients. Today's monitors need to be improved if such novel functionalities were to be offered for clinical use. Future developments and clinical evaluations are needed to establish the true potential of these advanced monitoring uses of pulse oximetry.",10.1213/ANE.0000000000001283,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,126,Preliminary assessment of an automatic screening device for peripheral arterial disease using ankle-brachial and toe-brachial indices,"Background and objectives Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is currently recommended for the screening of peripheral arterial disease. However, this method becomes less reliable in the presence of calcified, incompressible arteries, as they result in an erroneously elevated ABI, and an additional measure termed the toe-brachial index (TBI) is recommended. The evaluation of ABI, and in particular TBI, typically requires significant technical skill and often involves referral to a vascular laboratory. This present situation reveals the need for a valid and reliable, automatic, noninvasive device that will provide both ABI and TBI at the level of the primary care physician. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of such a device, the Vasera VS-1500AT, in the assessment of toe, ankle, and brachial systolic blood pressures. Materials and methods This study involved the assessment of 80 limbs from 40 normotensive and hypertensive individuals (17 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 45 +/- 18 years. Results There was a statistically significant correlation (r=0.92) between toe systolic blood pressures obtained manually with photoplethysmography compared with those obtained through the automated device. The same significant correlation was also seen between the two with ankle (r=0.87) and brachial (r=0.88) systolic blood pressures. Conclusion These strong correlations demonstrate that further investigation of this device is warranted regarding its use as a screening tool for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. The automation provided by this device could potentially eliminate variability in these measurements thereby allowing for screening and diagnosis to be done without referral to a vascular laboratory.

WOS,127,Assessment of the vascular effects of PC6 (Neiguan) using the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram in healthy and hypertensive subjects,"Indices obtained from the second derivative of the digital volume pulse waveform have been proposed to characterize vascular aging, arterial rigidity, and the effects of vasoactive drugs. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of manual needling of PC6 on SDDVP indices in healthy and untreated hypertensive subjects. AI, B:A, and D:A indices, based on the height of the wave components of SDDVP in 40 healthy subjects and 25 untreated hypertensive subjects were compared. DVP was obtained by measuring infrared light transmission through the finger. For each subject, 20-min-long DVP registration was obtained. PC6 was stimulated unilaterally by manual needling for 5 min (1-6 min). In each subject, pre-acupuncture DVP indices were compared to those of during acupuncture (1 vs. 4 min) and post-acupuncture (1 vs. 18 min). In healthy subjects, AI was significantly improved when comparing the pre- to the post-acupuncture values. In hypertensive subjects, the SDDVP indices improved significantly as follows: the AI index when the value of pre-acupuncture comparing to that of during acupuncture and post-acupuncture values; B:A and D:A indices when the pre-comparing to post-acupuncture values. There were significant differences between healthy and hypertensive subjects in AI, B:A, and D:A at baseline and in B:A in the during acupuncture period; there were no significant differences at post-acupuncture. These results indicate that manual needling of PC6 produced acute effects on vascular pathophysiology. Moreover, PC6 needling produced changes in SDDVP indices related to both large artery stiffness and the reflected wave originating in small arteries.",10.1142/S0192415X07004941,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,129,Large Artery Dysfunction in Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the arterial distensibility of large vessels and changes in microvasculature in primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Methods Twenty-two antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) patients and 66 age-, sex-, height-, and blood pressure-matched controls were evaluated. Second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) was used as a noninvasive method to evaluate the pulse wave. The b/a and d/a indices, which reflect, respectively, large-vessel and small-vessel properties, were calculated from the SDPTG waveform components. Vascular age index was also determined. Results Arterial thrombosis occurred in 59.1% (13/22) of APL patients, with a predominance of stroke episodes (61.5%). Venous thromboembolism was observed in 36.4% (all deep venous thrombosis), and obstetric complications in 36.4%. Frequency of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia was comparable in APL patients and control subjects (P > 0.05). Concerning plethysmography findings, b/a ratio was higher in patients than in control subjects (-0.44 0.16 vs. -0.54 +/- 0.18, P = 0.034), whereas d/a ratio (-0.30 +/- 0.16 vs. -0.31 +/- 0.18, P = 0.83) was comparable. Moreover, SDPTG (-0.16 +/- 0.35 vs. -0.30 +/- 0.38, P = 0.16) and vascular age index values (53.5 +/- 11.6 vs. 51.8 +/- 16.1, P = 0.65) were alike in both groups. Regarding disease-related factors, patients with arterial and venous thrombosis had similar b/a, d/a, and vascular age indices (P = 0.95; P = 0.06; P = 0.12, respectively). Conclusions The higher b/a ratio in APL patients suggests decreased distensibility of large arteries and may be why APL patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular events. The d/a ratio, that is considered a marker of small vessel vascular resistance, was not different than controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate vascular factors that predispose APL patients to atherosclerotic events.",10.1097/RHU.0000000000000618,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1097/rhu.0000000000000618)
WOS,130,Assessment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis in hypertensive subjects: Second derivative of photoplethysmogram versus pulse wave velocity,"The pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the photoplethysmogram (PTG) are noninvasive methods for evaluating the pulse wave. The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and pWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complier device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 +/- 4 m/sec v 12.4 +/- 2 m/sec, P < .001), PTG AUI (0.322 +/- 0.16 v 0.252 +/- 0.09, P < .001), and SDPTG AI (-0.093 +/- 0.03 v -0.271 +/- 0.018, P < .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients >60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG Al by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives.

WOS,131,Lower Limb Dynamic Activity Significantly Reduces Foot Skin Perfusion: Exploring Data with Different Optical Sensors in Age-Grouped Healthy Adults,"Introduction: The human lower limb is widely used as a model to study in vivo microcirculatory physiology and pathophysiology. It is a preferential target for critical comorbidities (overweight, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease). Movement and activity are consistently regarded as beneficial, but the related adaptive physiology is still poorly understood. Our goal was to better identify the foot microcirculatory changes after a regular walking gait activity in healthy subjects of different ages. Methods: Twelve healthy participants of both sexes, with normal BMI and Ankle-Brachial Index, were selected and grouped according to age - group I (21.0 +/- 1 y.o.) and group II (55.8 +/- 3 y.o.). The protocol involved 2 phases of 5-min duration each - phase 1, a static standing position, and phase 2, 5-min walking with a comfortable pace on a pre-established circuit. Perfusion changes were assessed in the dorsal region of both feet before (baseline, phase 1) and after (phase 2) the gait period by noninvasive optical technologies - laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), photoplethysmography, and polarized spectroscopy (PSp). Comparative statistics were performed with a 95% confidence level. Results: All instruments detected an asymmetric nonsignificant perfusion between right and left feet during rest in all participants with values in females consistently lower than men. Older participants exhibited lower baseline values than the younger group. Gait evoked a perfusion reduction in all participants relative to phase 1 detected with all technologies, with statistically significant changes recorded with LDF (group I, p = 0.033, and group II, p = 0.028) and PSp (group II, p = 0.041). Furthermore, LDF revealed that gait significantly reduced perfusion velocity in the older group (p = 0.003). Corresponding changes in the younger group were present but discrete. Recovery to baseline levels was also slower in the older group. Discussion/Conclusions: Our results confirm that perfusion is age dependent and demonstrate the clinical relevance of simple dynamic activities such as gait. This reduction of the dorsal foot perfusion occurs in depth, being more pronounced with the movement intensity, suggesting a wide application potential in early diagnostics as for rehabilitation.",10.1159/000517906,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1159/000517906)
WOS,132,Relationship of Non-Invasive Arterial Stiffness Parameters with 10-Year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score in Post-COVID-19 Patients-The Results of a Cross-Sectional Study,"This study evaluated the relationship of non-invasive arterial stiffness parameters with an individual 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events in the cohort post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study group included 203 convalescents aged 60.0 (55.0-63.0) and 115 (56.7%) women. The ASCVD risk was assessed as low to moderate to very high based on medical history (for 62 participants with pre-existing ASCVD/diabetes/chronic kidney disease in the entire cohort) or calculated in percentages using the Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) algorithm based on age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure (BP), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for 141 healthy participants). The stiffness index (SI) and reflection index (RI) measured by photoplethysmography, as well as pulse pressure (PP), calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BP, were markers of arterial stiffness. Stiffness parameters increased significantly with the increase in ASCVD risk in the entire cohort. In 30 (14.8%) patients in the low- to moderate-risk group, the median SI was 8.07 m/s (7.10-8.73), RI 51.40% (39.40-65.60), and PP 45.50 mmHg (40.00-57.00); in 111 (54.7%) patients in the high-risk group, the median SI was 8.70 m/s (7.40-10.03), RI 57.20% (43.65-68.40), and PP 54.00 mmHg (46.00-60.75); and in 62 (30.5%) patients in the very-high-risk group, the median was SI 9.27 m/s (7.57-10.44), RI 59.00% (50.40-72.40), and PP 60.00 mmHg (51.00-67.00). In healthy participants, the SI <= 9.0 m/s (sensitivity of 92.31%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.686, p < 0.001) based on the receiver operating characteristics was the most sensitive variable for discriminating low to moderate risk, and PP > 56.0 mmHg (sensitivity of 74.36%, AUC 0.736, p < 0.001) was used for discriminating very high risk. In multivariate logistic regression, younger age, female sex, PP <= 50 mmHg, SI <= 9.0 m/s, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL had the best relationship with low to moderate SCORE2 risk. In turn, older age, currently smoking, PP > 56.0 mmHg, RI > 68.6%, and diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg were related to very high SCORE2 risk. In conclusion, arterial stiffness is significantly related to ASCVD risk in post-COVID-19 patients and can be helpful as a single risk marker in everyday practice. Cut-off points for arterial stiffness parameters determined based on SCORE2 may help make individual decisions about implementing lifestyle changes or pharmacological treatment of ASCVD risk factors",10.3390/life14091105,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.3390/life14091105)
WOS,133,Assessment of vasoactive agents and vascular aging by the second derivative of photoplethysmogram waveform,"To evaluate the clinical application of the second derivative of the fingertip photoplethysmogram waveform, we performed drug administration studies (study 1) and epidemiological studies (study 2). In study 1, ascending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean+/-SD age of 54+/-11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 mu g angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40+/-0.13 to -0.62+/-0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to -0.25+/-0.12 (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P<0.001, and r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P<0.001, y=0.023x-1.515), The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06+/-0.36 versus -0.22+/-0.41, P<0.01). Women had a higher aging index than men (P<0.01). The b-c-d-e/a ratio may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging and for screening of arteriosclerotic disease.",10.1161/01.HYP.32.2.365,NO,Duplicate DOI (already seen: 10.1161/01.hyp.32.2.365)
WOS,134,Investigation of endothelial function by pulse contour analysis: a protocol for drug administration and timing of pulse contour assessment,"center dot Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new technique used for non-invasive assessment of endothelial function. center dot Endothelial dysfunction is a component of a number of common conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a variety of inflammatory conditions. center dot A standardized method for assessing endothelial function using pulse contour analysis is required to allow comparison between studies. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS center dot This study recommends the optimal dose of vasoactive agents and timing of measurements for the assessment of endothelial function using pulse contour analysis. AIMS Pulse contour analysis (PCA) obtained by finger photoplethysmography produces a digital volume pulse (DVP) including an inflection point in its down-slope. The reflection index (RI: ratio of the inflection point height over the maximal DVP) is responsive to vasodilatation. We aimed to optimize the drug dose and time interval for assessing endothelial function using PCA in healthy volunteers and patients with severe coronary artery disease. METHODS Time and dose to RI response relationships were constructed in 16 volunteers and nine patients to inhaled salbutamol (100-400 mu g) or sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG; 25-400 mu g). RESULTS For the volunteers, the time to maximum RI response to inhaled salbutamol and sublingual NTG was 10.73 +/- 0.41 and 3.66 +/- 0.21 min, respectively. A plateau in the RI response to salbutamol occurred between 5 and 15 min after inhalation and results were averaged over this period. A dose-dependent response was observed to inhaled salbutamol and sublingual NTG (P = 0.05 and P < 0.001 by repeated-measures anova, respectively) in healthy volunteers. By contrast, in patients with severe coronary artery disease inhaled salbutamol (100-400 mu g) did not cause a significant change in RI. CONCLUSIONS In healthy volunteers the RI response to inhaled salbutamol (100-200 mu g) averaged over 5-15 min after administration may be used to investigate endothelial function by PCA. The response to sublingual NTG (50 mu g) should be determined at 4 min. This technique may not be suitable for the assessment of endothelial function in subjects with extensive coronary artery disease owing to the small responses observed and potential confounding effect of vasoactive medication.",10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03482.x,YES,Unique DOI
WOS,46,Research on multi-parameter fusion non-invasive blood glucose detection method based on machine learning,"OBJECTIVE: Traditional blood glucose testing methods have several disadvantages, such as high pain and poor acquisition continuity.

WOS,79,Effect of source wavelength on second derivative of finger photoplethysmogram in healthy young female volunteers.,"Background: Non-invasive methods for screening and diagnosis are the field with fast growing interest which leads to various biological signal measurements like Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and pressure pulse. PPG monitoring is widely used in the healthcare as this single pulse study can provide wide physiological information non-invasively such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure (continuous and cuff less), blood volume, arterial stiffness and respiration rate. First and second derivatives of PPG provide important information about the arterial stiffness and vascular health of the person. Aim: This paper explains the design and development of prototype with RED LED (660 nm) and IR LED (860 nm) as a source and OPT 101 as a detector. Second derivative related indices of PPG (for RED LED and IR LED) were calculated. Materials and methods: Study was carried out on 15 healthy female subjects without any known history of blood pressure and blood glucose; aged between 19-23 years. Results and conclusion: Amplitude of PPG obtained from RED LED is smaller than the amplitude of PPG obtained from IR LED. Comparative analysis of first and second derivative of the PPG obtained from RED light source and IR light source is discussed by the authors. It was observed that various parameters studied from second derivative are the 'Normalized Values', so effect of change in the amplitude of the PPG signal obtained from RED LED and IR LED get nullified in this study (P>0.05). Though IR source based reflective type of sensor related study can be useful in future for the brain vascular health assessment.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)
WOS,85,Measuring Toe Pressures Using a Portable Photoplethysmograph to Detect Arterial Disease in High-risk Patients: An Overview of the Literature,"Lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) is estimated to affect one third of individuals older than 65 years of age, occurs in younger individuals who use tobacco or have diabetes mellitus (DM), and often remains undiagnosed until a patient presents with ischemia-related symptoms or complications. Valid and reliable noninvasive tests such as the ankle-brachial index (ABI) are recommended to detect LEAD. However, ABI results can be inconclusive or the index can be elevated (ie, >1.3) in persons with calcified ankle arteries due to DM, renal failure, or arthritis. In these instances, obtaining toe pressure (TP) measurements, which correlate well with angiographic findings, is advised, providing the patient does not have vasoconstriction with cold toes or vasospastic disease. In such cases, TP can be obtained using a portable photoplethysmograph (PPG), which offers a simple and inexpensive method for healthcare providers in a variety of clinical settings to assess for the presence of LEAD. Portable PPG TP measurements have been found to have a high level of agreement with vascular laboratory PPG tests to detect LEAD, as well as good sensitivity and a high specificity. Adopting a TP measurement protocol of care to assess high-risk individuals such as patients with DM and elevated ABIs potentially can have a major impact on early identification of LEAD and reduce the risk of ischemia-related complications, including lower extremity wounds and amputations.",,NO,Duplicate Title (already seen: measuring toe pressures using a portable photoplet...)

Besides the heart rate and the heart rate variability the introduced pulse ratio PQ represents a sufficient diagnostic parameter in patients suffering from AOD, so that an early diagnosis and controls of progress of peripheral vascular diseases and therapy monitoring seems to be possible.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)
WOS,125,NIRP-method versus ProSciCard-system in autonomic cardiac neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus,"The periods derived from ECG (R-R-distance) by means of the ProSciCard-system and from microvascular blood volume pulsation by means of the NIRP-method (HEK-system) are agreeing with sufficient accuracy for the analysed applications in this investigation. There was found a closed correlation between heart and pulse rate (r=0,997) and heart and pulse rate variability (r=0,979), The NIRP-method is more advantageous, because it is possible by this method to investigate the form of signal of blood volume pulsation additionally, so that is possible to derive peripheral circulatory parameters additionally. Close to the rigidity and the raising of the heart rate in the tachogram of heart periods and decreased heart rate variability in diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CADN) it should be examined if there is a respiratoric sinus arrhythmia or not by means of deriving autocorrelational function of heart period duration, Just so tests of cardiac autonomic function like the resting ventilation/hyperventilation and the Ewing-test are especially suitable. The last may be accomplished on tilt table without disturbances. A simple possible classification of CADN is proposed whitch should be tested in further investigations.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)
WOS,128,Detection of structural changes of large arteries by characteristics of peripheral pulse wave: Comparison with high resolution ultrasonic investigation,"Aim. To compare high-resolution ultrasound of major arteries and the method of vascular stiffness evaluation by digital volume pulse photoplethysmography after sublingual nitroglycerin in diagnosis of structural vascular changes. Material and methods. The comparison of the two methods was made in 110 volunteers (mean age 31.9 +/- 11.5 years). The study protocol included measurement of blood pressure (BP), blood lipids and glucose, evaluation of IMT of the carotid arteries by ultrasonography, baseline stiffness index (SIbl) and after sublingual nitroglycerin (SIng) by photoplethysmography. Reproducibility of photoplethysmography was evaluated in 20 volunteers (mean age 20.3 +/- 1.4 years) with repeated measurement after 1 week. The results were tested in 40 volunteers of different age groups. Results. There were significant correlations of IMT, SIN and SIng with risk factors and close interrelations of these parameters. SIng better explained variability of IMT compared to SIN (r = 0. 79, R-2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 001 versus r = 0. 67, R-2 = 0. 45, p < 0. 001, respectively). Relations of LUT with risk factors were lost after correction for SIng. Reproducibility of SIng was higher than SIN ( +/- 5.1 % versus +/- 10.9%, respectively) and than those for IMT found in the literature. Mean LUT values for random sample evaluated by ultrasonography and calculated by estimated equation of linear regression for SIng and IMT did not differ significantly (0.576 +/- 0.087 mm versus 0.570 +/- 0.074 mm, p = 0.44; r = 0. 71, p < 0. 001, mean difference 0. 007 +/- 0.051 mm). Conclusion. The method of vascular stiffness measurement is comparable with ultrasonography in terms of vessel structure evaluation and possesses higher reproducibility. The test with nitroglycerin substantially increases its diagnostic potential and reproducibility.",,YES,Unique Title (no DOI)
