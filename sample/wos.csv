This invasive method is not capable of continuously monitoring a diabetic patient's blood glucose levels and can be painful and inconvenient in the long term. In our study, we developed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation method using dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with pulse arrival velocity (PAV). The dual-channel PPG was chosen based on the advantages of 530 nm PPG in blood flow measurement and 1550 nm infrared light in blood glucose concentration detection. In addition to testing various amplitude features in PPG at different fiducial points (systolic peak, dicrotic notch, and diastolic peak), we also examined the amplitude ratio between the two PPG channels (530 nm green-light PPG and 1550 nm infrared PPG), as well as PAV, for noninvasive blood glucose estimation. In this study, we recruited 18 healthy subjects (14 males and four females; aged 29.4 +/- 7.87 years old). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) experiment was conducted on each participant to manipulate the blood glucose level. Each parameter for blood glucose estimation was examined using partial F-test to assess its impact on blood glucose estimation. We found that combining the amplitude ratio of the dual-channel PPG with PAV resulted in the best blood glucose estimation results, with estimation results falling within Zone A in the Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) with a 100% success rate, and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 7.46 +/- 2.43 mg/dL.",,,,,"Chih-Hao, Chen/A-7349-2008; chen, ying/HHS-8254-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-437X,1558-1748,,,,1-Oct,2023,23,19,,,,,23570,23582,,10.1109/JSEN.2023.3306343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2023.3306343,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001087769200140,View Full Record in Web of Science

Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR). The PPG readout circuit consists of a switched capacitor Transimpedance amplifier with 1 M omega gain and a 10-Hz switched capacitor LPF. It allows a DC bias current rejection up to 20 mu A with an input-referred current noise of 7.3 pA/root Hz. The proposed digital processor eliminates motion artifacts, and baseline drifts from PPG signal, extracts six distinct features and finally predicts the blood glucose level using Support Vector Regression with Fine Gaussian kernel (FGSVR) MLR. A novel piece-wise linear (PWL) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the FGSVR on-chip. The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with a chip area of 4.0 mm(2) while consuming 1.62 mW. The glucose measurements are performed for 200 subjects with R-2 of 0.937.

This study focuses on noninvasively measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using PPG signals. In particular, the study relates to a method and a hardware design technology for removing noise that may be present in a PPG signal due to skin contact with a noninvasive HbA1c measurement device.

To compare the performance of the MGGP model, several classical regression models are also developed using the same input condition as the MGGP model. A comparison between MGGP based model and classical regression models have been done by estimating different error measurement indexes.

The primary challenge in diabetes management is maintaining blood glucose levels (BGLs) within a safe range to prevent complications such as renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy. Traditional methods, such as finger-prick testing, often result in low patient adherence due to discomfort, invasiveness, and inconvenience. Consequently, there is an increasing need for non-invasive techniques that provide accurate BGL measurements. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a photosensitive method that detects blood volume variations, has shown promise for non-invasive glucose monitoring. Deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to PPG signals can predict BGLs with high accuracy. However, training DNN models requires large and diverse datasets, which are typically distributed across multiple healthcare institutions. Privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions further limit data sharing, making conventional centralized machine learning (ML) approaches less effective. To address these challenges, this study proposes a federated learning (FL)-based solution that enables multiple healthcare organizations to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw patient data, thereby enhancing model performance while ensuring data privacy and security. In the data preprocessing stage, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to smooth PPG signals and remove baseline drift. Adaptive cycle-based segmentation (ACBS) is then used for signal segmentation, followed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection, optimizing classification accuracy. The proposed system was evaluated on diverse datasets, including VitalDB and MUST, under various conditions with data collected during surgery and anesthesia. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.1 mg/dL, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) confirmed the model's clinical reliability, with 99.31% of predictions falling within clinically acceptable limits.

The photoplethysmography signal, containing various physiological and pathological information, is widely used in various clinical studies and is also the focus of attention in the current implementation of the non-invasive glucose detection technique. Current studies of non-invasive blood glucose detection based on photoplethysmography signals have only considered the contribution to system modelling when the time or frequency domains act alone. Although the time domain analysis of the signal can describe the variation of the PPG signal amplitude with time, it cannot visually reflect the energy distribution of the PPG signal frequency. Therefore, the signal analysis of a single domain cannot fully express the PPG signal, which leads to information loss. When using frequency domain analysis to extract the signal spectrum, it is necessary to use all the time domain information of the signal, which is a global transformation and may result in the loss of signal characteristics at a specific time or in a specific frequency band. In summary, this paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on the integrated time-frequency domain analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG), using a parallel time-frequency domain method to consider the association between the photoplethysmography signal and blood glucose, a cluster analysis method is used to extract representative waveforms in the time domain of the PPG signal, analyze the correlation between the waveform features and blood glucose, and determine the time domain feature parameters of the waveform. On this basis, the pulse waveform time domain signal is converted to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform, and the spectral information is studied using principal component analysis to establish the frequency domain characteristic quantities. The BP neural network-based non-invasive blood glucose detection model is constructed by extracting the time-frequency domain feature parameters from the waveform signals obtained through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and using the invasive blood glucose concentration detected in real time as a reference. At the same time, in order to improve the accuracy of the model and achieve model optimization, a genetic algorithm is applied to the model for the second correction, and the final MAE and RMSE of the test set reach 1.13 and 1.42 mmol center dot L-1. The results of Parker's CEG show that the prediction results in the A and B regions accounted for 80.3% and 19.7%, respectively, which indicates that the method has good prediction accuracy and provides a theoretical basis for the feasibility of daily non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. It is beneficial to improve the detection and monitoring systems for diabetes, to judge the condition better comprehensively, and to prevent, guide, and treat diabetes promptly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,FEB,2024,44,2,,,,,318,324,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0599-3(2024)02-0318-07,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0599-3(2024)02-0318-07,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001202623000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Few studies discuss prediction accuracy in the case of a large time interval span between modeling and prediction. This paper proposes an automatic optimal threshold baseline removal algorithm based on variational mode decomposition (AOT-VMD), which can adaptively eliminate high-frequency noise and baseline interference for each decomposed IMF modal component and reduce the baseline difference of PPG signals from different days. Furthermore, a fuzzy integral multi-model decision fusion algorithm based on error weight is proposed. The fuzzy integral operator is introduced to make the features with large contributions in each sub-model maintain a high-weight value in the overall prediction mechanism, which improves the prediction accuracy of blood glucose. In this paper, a self-developed portable PPG glucose meter is used to collect PPG signals, and the true blood glucose values for 8 consecutive days are collected by CGM. The proposed algorithm is used to build a model with the first day's data and predict the blood glucose values for the remaining 7 days. The experimental results show that the AOT-VMD preprocessing algorithm and the quantitative regression algorithm of the fuzzy integral multiple model decision fusion algorithm proposed in this paper perform well in measurement accuracy and time adaptability compared with the traditional methods. In addition, the proposed method requires less invasive calibration samples in the modeling stage, achieving high-precision prediction for a long period. 100% of the samples are located in areas A and B of the Clarke area in this experiment, and the algorithm has strong time generalization ability.

Recent evidences, however, suggest that the value of glycemia at 1 h during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a stronger predictor for developing diabetes than the value at 2 h and that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Studies in cells, animals, and humans suggest that 1-h high glucose is a sufficient stimulus for increasing several cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction, with oxidative stress generation as the possible pathogenetic factor. One-hour glucose might be more dangerous than that at 2 h simply because glycemia is higher at 1 h, during an OGTT and postmeal. The new drugs, able to target better 1 h glycemia and the new noninvasive technologies for glucose monitoring, nowadays may help to change the therapeutic paradigm of targeting PPG at 2 h.",,,,,"Ceriello, Antonio/J-9575-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1520-9156,1557-8593,,,,SEP,2017,19,9,,,,,493,497,,10.1089/dia.2017.0135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2017.0135,,,,,,,,28665142,,,,,WOS:000411175300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article, we aimed to construct a novel multi-modal framework based on ECG and PPG signal fusion to establish a universal BG monitoring model. This is proposed as a spatiotemporal decision fusion strategy that uses weight-based Choquet integral for BG monitoring. Specifically, the multimodal framework performs three-level fusion. First, ECG and PPG signals are collected and coupled into different pools. Second, the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features in the ECG and PPG signals are extracted through numerical analysis and residual networks, respectively. Furthermore, the suitable temporal statistical features are determined with three feature selection techniques, and the spatial morphological features are compressed by deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, weight-based Choquet integral multimodel fusion is integrated for coupling different BG monitoring algorithms based on the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features. To verify the feasibility of the model, a total of 103 days of ECG and PPG signals encompassing 21 participants were collected in this article. The BG levels of participants ranged between 2.2 and 21.8 mmol/L. The results obtained show that the proposed model has excellent BG monitoring performance with a root-meansquare error (RMSE) of 1.49 mmol/L, mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 13.42%, and Zone A + B of 99.49% in tenfold cross-validation.

J,"Chen, JH; Lin, ZQ; Sun, CY",,,,Chen Jian-hong; Lin Zhi-qiang; Sun Chao-yue,,,Determination of New Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Detection Method Based on Spectral Decomposition,SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diabetes is a disease of abnormal glucose metabolism that manifests as hyperglycemia. If the glucose level in the blood remains very low or very high for long periods, it could cause serious diseases including tissue damage, stroke, heart disease, blindness and kidney failure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), currently there are around 450 million cases of diabetes in the world. With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for glucose measuring equipment has become increasingly urgent. As the currently popular invasive blood glucose measuring equipment will cause inconvenience and pain to patients and may even cause infections, it will inevitably bring psychological and physiological pressure to patients in the long term. Therefore, the realization of non-invasive blood glucose measurement has important clinical application value. Photoplethysmography(PPG) pulse wave contains abundant information about human cardiovascular physiology and pathology. This paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on spectral decomposition, aiming at the spectral information related to blood glucose concentration changes in the PPG signal that is difficult to observe in the time domain Continuous Wavelet Transform(CWT) is used to decompose the PPG signal from the corresponding scale and details in order to obtain the spectral component amplitude information related to the change of blood glucose concentration. Studies have found that there is a higher correlation between the change in the amplitude of the PPG signal spectral components and the changes in the blood glucose concentration. Through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), the detected blood glucose concentration and the obtained relevant PPG signal spectral components amplitude is modeled by partial least square regression, and the established model is evaluated. The Root Mean Square of Calibration (RMSEC) of the calibration set is 12.47 mg . dL(-1), which is 0.69 mmol . L-1, and the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of the prediction set is 6.21 mg . dL(-1), which is 0.35 mmol . L-1. The agreement between the predicted value of model's blood glucose concentration and the reference value is 96.00%. The results of the OGTT experiments show that the spectral decomposition method can effectively separate the vibration characteristic absorption spectra of blood glucose molecular groups, and the blood glucose spectral component modeling can minimize the impact of physiological variability and various environmental conditions. The prediction results of the model meet the national testing standards (>95%). Clark grid error analysis show that the results predicted by this method can be used for daily blood glucose monitoring of patients.",,,,,"Lin, Zhiqiang/KHV-3285-2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,AUG,2021,41,8,,,,,2378,2383,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)08-2378-06,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)08-2378-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000696005000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This trial tested a wrist-borne non-invasive glucose monitor (NIGM) to measure blood glucose (BG) levels using photoplethysmographic (PPG) optical sensors. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of the device in comparison with a standard, invasive clinical method for blood glucose monitoring. Adult participants (n = 200) of both sexes from 18 to 75 were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria: hemophilia and other serious coagulation disorders, impaired venous access, other serious medical conditions. A biosensor was placed on the right wrist of each participant for a non-invasive indirect BG measurement. In parallel, blood from the antecubital vein was collected and glucose levels were assessed with YSI 2300 Bioanalyzer. The measurements were performed twice: before and after food intake, with a 1-h interval between measurements. There were no limitations to food type and quantity. In both anteprandial (rho = 0.8994, p < 0.0001) and postprandial (rho = 0.9382, p < 0.0001) glucose measurements, NIGM correlated with values obtained by the YSI 2300 reference device - there was no significant difference between the two methods. Plotted on a Parkes Error Grid for Type II diabetes, NIGM readings did not deviate from those of the YSI 2300 in any clinically-significant way, with the majority of correlated readings falling within Parkes zone A. Very few readings fell within Parkes zone B. In anteprandial measurements, the mean bias between methods for all patient volunteers was 3.705 +/- 7.838. In postprandial measurements gave a mean bias of 1.362 +/- 10.15 for all patient glucose data.

A.; Guha, Shion; Love, Richard R.; Ahamed, Sheikh",,,Noninvasive Hemoglobin Level Prediction in a Mobile Phone Environment: State of the Art Review and Recommendations,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background: There is worldwide demand for an affordable hemoglobin measurement solution, which is a particularly urgent need in developing countries. The smartphone, which is the most penetrated device in both rich and resource-constrained areas, would be a suitable choice to build this solution. Consideration of a smartphone-based hemoglobin measurement tool is compelling because of the possibilities for an affordable, portable, and reliable point-of-care tool by leveraging the camera capacity, computing power, and lighting sources of the smartphone. However, several smartphone-based hemoglobin measurement techniques have encountered significant challenges with respect to data collection methods, sensor selection, signal analysis processes, and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive methods is required to recommend a hemoglobin measurement process using a smartphone device. Objective: In this study, we analyzed existing invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive approaches for blood hemoglobin level measurement with the goal of recommending data collection techniques, signal extraction processes, feature calculation strategies, theoretical foundation, and machine-learning algorithms for developing a noninvasive hemoglobin level estimation point-of-care tool using a smartphone. Methods: We explored research papers related to invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive hemoglobin level measurement processes. We investigated the challenges and opportunities of each technique. We compared the variation in data collection sites, biosignal processing techniques, theoretical foundations, photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal and features extraction process, machine-learning algorithms, and prediction models to calculate hemoglobin levels. This analysis was then used to recommend realistic approaches to build a smartphone-based point-of-care tool for hemoglobin measurement in a noninvasive manner. Results: The fingertip area is one of the best data collection sites from the body, followed by the lower eye conjunctival area. Near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diode (LED) light with wavelengths of 850 nm, 940 nm, and 1070 nm were identified as potential light sources to receive a hemoglobin response from living tissue. PPG signals from fingertip videos, captured under various light sources, can provide critical physiological clues. The features of PPG signals captured under 1070 nm and 850 nm NIR LED are considered to be the best signal combinations following a dual-wavelength theoretical foundation. For error metrics presentation, we recommend the mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error, correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plot. Conclusions: We addressed the challenges of developing an affordable, portable, and reliable point-of-care tool for hemoglobin measurement using a smartphone. Leveraging the smartphone's camera capacity, computing power, and lighting sources, we define specific recommendations for practical point-of-care solution development. We further provide recommendations to resolve several long-standing research questions, including how to capture a signal using a smartphone camera, select the best body sitefor signal collection, and overcome noise issues in the smartphone-captured signal. We also describe the process of extracting a signal's features after capturing the signal based on fundamental theory. The list of machine-learning algorithms provided will be useful for processing PPG features. These recommendations should be valuable for future investigators seeking to build a reliable and affordable hemoglobin prediction model using a smartphone.",,,,,"Hasan, Kamrul/AAY-6295-2020; Hashem, M.M.A./AAE-8430-2020","Hashem, M.M.A./0000-0001-7483-9683; Aziz, Md Hasanul/0000-0002-0177-6586; AHAMED, SHEIKH IQBAL/0000-0001-5385-7647; Zarif, Md Ishrak Islam/0000-0003-3491-0240; Guha, Shion/0000-0003-0073-2378; Hasan, Mahmudul/0000-0002-4386-0356",,,,,,,,,,,,,2291-5222,,,,,8-Apr,2021,9,4,,,,,,,e16806,10.2196/16806,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16806,,,,,,,,33830065,,,,,WOS:000669019500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It does not receive enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain while walking which is known as claudication. It is a common manifestation of type-2 Diabetes, but the relationship between other vascular diseases and lower limb peripheral arterial disease (LLPAD) has been poorly understood and investigated. Methods: When assessing a patient with clinical LLPAD, 2 methods are used to establish a diagnosis: one is noninvasive testing and other is invasive. Invasive methods are painful and get so bad that some people need to have a leg surgery. People with diabetes are at increased risk for amputation, and it is used only when the damage is very severe. Results: Diagnosis of LLPAD begins with a physical examination, patient history, and certain questionnaire, and noninvasive mode of diagnosis is started for the screening of patients. Clinicians check for weak pulses in the legs and then decide for further diagnosis. This article discusses the prevalence of LLPAD worldwide and in India, along with the clinical effectiveness and limitations of these methods in case of diabetes. Conclusions: The focus of this review is to discuss only those noninvasive methods that are widely used for screening of LLPAD, such as ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and use of photoplethysmogram (PPG) especially in case of diabetic patients. Also, this article gives an overview of the work carried out using ABI, TBI, and PPG for detection of LLPAD.

A.",,,A Novel Technique for Non-Invasive Measurement of Human Blood Component Levels From Fingertip Video Using DNN Based Models,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Blood components such as hemoglobin, glucose, creatinine measuring are essential for monitoring one's health condition. The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful, and uncomfortable for the patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine level based on PPG signal using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1st and 2nd) and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included to feature because of the significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and over-fitting. Finally, DNN based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R-2 = 0.922 for Hb, R-2 = 0.902 for Gl, and R-2 = 0.969 for Cr. Experimental aftermaths show that the proposed method is a suitable technique to be used clinically to measure human blood component levels without taking blood samples.

The long-term presence of elevated blood sugar levels commonly results in peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with PVO disease have decreased walking capability and life quality in diabetes mellitus and poor peripheral circulation of PVO causes morbidity like infection and amputation of the legs or feet of diabetics. This progressively vascular occlusion is often ignored by the patients and primary care physicians in early stage. Therefore, a reliable method of diagnostic assistance is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring of PVO and prevention of amputation. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for detecting blood volume changes in peripheral vascular bed. Literature indicates that the pulse transit time increases and waveform shape changes increase in PPG of the vascular occlusion. PPG pulses of feet gradually become asynchronous due to the different speed of deteriorating patency and collateral circulation in the peripheral arteries. We utilized synchronizing chaotification to compare the bilateral similarity and asymmetry of PPG signals, and applied SVM to estimate three degrees of PVO. Among 33 subjects tested, this classification technique could recognize various butterfly motion patterns representing severities successfully including normal condition, lower-degree disease, and higher-degree disease. The proposed method has potential for providing diagnostic assistance for PVO of diabetics and other high-risk populations, with efficiency and higher accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In 10 healthy subjects, we observed clear cardiac-related pulsatile components of PPG signals at 808 and 1160 nm in any incident positions with more than 15 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), but reliable PPG detections at 1600 nm with more than 10 dB of S/N was only possible when the source-detector distance was less than 3mm around the fingertip circumference. Second, with this arrangement, an experiment was performed using six wavelengths to cover glucose absorption bands (from 1550 to 1749 nm), obtaining pulsatile PPG signals with more or less 15 dB of S/N. Through the present experiments, this orthogonal arrangement of the source and detector to detect forward-and side-scattered radiation through the tissue is appropriate for PPG measurements with wavelength regions where there is potential for BGL measurement.

Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the PPG signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a PPG signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of BGL values. A PPG data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. BGL value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and BGL value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of BGL value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R-2=0.81. Further, BGL estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R-2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for BGL estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6% in class A and 17.4% in class B. 1% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique (SPA) the distribution of data samples are 83% in class A and 17% in class B.

J,"Monte-Moreno, E",,,,"Monte-Moreno, Enric",,,Non-invasive estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph by means of machine learning techniques,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Objective: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were R-SBP(2) = 0.91, R-DBP(2) = 0.89, and R-BGL(2) = 0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7% of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B. and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

These events often occur without apparent symptoms, posing a challenge for diabetic patients in managing their condition. Therefore, a non-invasive wearable device capable of continuously measuring multiple body signals to predict hypoglycemic events would be highly beneficial. In this study, a wearable patch that continuously measures glucose, temperature, and HRV is presented. The device uses a novel power harvesting system to convert radiofrequency (RF) signals with the frequency of 2.45 GHz to direct current (DC) signals to extend the battery life for further continuous monitoring. The patch is small and has a conformal structure that can easily fit onto different body parts. The screen-printed glucose sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of 10.3 nA cm-2 mu M-1, a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.9 mu M, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 27 mu M. The device employs a photoplethysmography (PPG) module with a peak-finding algorithm to calculate the HRV values. In vivo experiments demonstrate the validation of the device's proper operation in glucose, HRV, and temperature measurement.

However, this enhancement came at the cost of requiring an additional HbA1c measurement, thus being unfriendly to users. In this study, the enhanced HbA1c NIBG deep learning model (blood glucose level predicted from PPG and HbA1c) was trained with 1494 measurements, and we replaced the HbA1c measurement (explicit HbA1c) with implicit HbA1c which is reversely derived from pretested PPG and finger-pricked blood glucose levels. The implicit HbA1c is then evaluated across intervals up to 90 days since the pretest, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy, while the remaining 13% falls near the CEG zone A boundary. The implicit HbA1c approach exhibits a remarkable 16% improvement over the explicit HbA1c method by covering personal correction items automatically. This improvement not only refines the accuracy of the model but also enhances the practicality of the previously proposed model that relied on an HbA1c input.

This study investigated the correlation between cardiopulmonary endurance indices and plasma glucose levels and abdominal visceral fat in males with new-onset type 2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 136 male individuals, who had been treated in the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao City, were selected to form a new-onset type 2 diabetes group (66 cases) and a control group (70 cases); individuals were divided into three groups (Q1, Q2, and Q3) from low to high according to their anaerobic threshold (AT) oxygen uptake (VO2), AT VO2/kg (VO2 per kg of body weight), peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT heart rate (HR), peak HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. A cardiopulmonary exercise test was used to determine the VO2 of each group of subjects for VO2 max and AT VO2/kg, HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. The differences in fat areas and plasma glucose levels were compared under different cardiorespiratory endurance indicators. Results: Compared with the control group, the abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels increased in the new-onset type 2 diabetes group.

The higher the AT VO2 and peak VO2 values, the lower the PPG level (P<0.05) and the smaller the area of abdominal visceral fat (P<0.05). The AT VO2/kg and peak VO2/kg values were negatively correlated with the abdominal visceral fat area, while other indicators had no obvious relationship with either plasma glucose levels or the area of fat.

However, it is difficult to deploy broadly in primary care settings due to its high cost and timeconsuming. This study proposed a fast and inexpensive technique for predicting TcPO2 using the characteristic features of the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and various machine learning algorithms. Methods: The toe PPG signals of 149 subjects were collected, and 12 characteristic features were extracted according to contour analysis, followed by TcPO2 measurements. TcPO2 measurements were performed on the dorsum of the foot by PeriFlux 6000 TcPO2 system. In addition to PPG features, physiological parameters were also taken into account. A variety of machine learning regression approaches, including extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and Ridge regression (Ridge), were used to predict TcPO2 levels. To evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, different performance indicators such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient were employed. Correlation analysis and BlandAltman plot analysis were performed to visualize the data. Results: XGBoost outperformed the other three regression models in predicting TcPO2 (R = 0.835, MAE = 5.23 mmHg, RMSE = 6.87 mmHg, MAPE = 9.99%). Reflection index, diabetes, duration of diabetes, heart rate, crest time, the time between the systolic and diastolic peaks (& UDelta;T) were the top six contributions to TcPO2 prediction in the XGBoost model. The PPG characteristic features play a dominant role in TcPO2 estimation. Diabetes and duration of diabetes were also significant factors in TcPO2 prediction. Conclusions: We compared four machine learning methods for TcPO2 prediction. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance of all the algorithms investigated and could be used to forecast TcPO2 values.

This paper begins by addressing the market status of wrist-worn wearable devices, followed by an explanation of the fundamental principles underlying light operation and its interaction with living tissue for PPG measurements. Moving on to technological advancements, the paper addresses the analog front end for the measurement of the PPG signal, sensor configurations with multiple light emitters and receivers, the minimum sampling rate required for low-power systems, and the measurement of stress, sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, and activity using PPG signals. Several challenges in the field are also identified, including selecting the appropriate wavelength for the PPG sensor's light source, developing low-power interpolation methods to extract high-resolution inter-beat intervals at a low sampling rate, and exploring the measurement of physiological phenomena using multi-wavelength PPG signals simultaneously collected at the same location. Lastly, the paper presents future research directions, which encompass the development of new, reliable parameters specific to wearable PPG devices and conducting studies in real-world scenarios, such as 24-h long-term measurements.",,,,,,"Baek, Hyun Jae/0000-0003-1347-7388; Kim, Kwang Bok/0000-0002-3672-5615",,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-9292,,,,,JUL,2023,12,13,,,,,,,2923,10.3390/electronics12132923,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics12132923,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001030940800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

As illustrated in this work, we increased the number subjects recruited to 2538 and found that the prediction accuracy (the ratio in zone A of Clarke's error grid) reduced to undesirable 60.6%. We suspect the low prediction accuracy induced by larger sample size might arise from the physiological diversity of subjects, and one possibility is that the diversity might originate from medication. Therefore, we split the subjects into two cohorts for deep learning: with and without medication (1682 and 856 recruited subjects, respectively). In comparison, the cohort training for subjects without any medication had approximately 30% higher prediction accuracy over the cohort training for those with medication. Furthermore, by adding quarterly (every 3 months) measured glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), we were able to significantly boost the prediction accuracy by approximately 10%. For subjects without medication, the best performing model with quarterly measured HbA1c achieved 94.3% prediction accuracy, RMSE of 12.4 mg/dL, MAE of 8.9 mg/dL, and MAPE of 0.08, which demonstrates a very promising solution for NIBG prediction via deep learning.

Thus, monitoring blood glucose levels and the diagnosis of diabetes in the early stages is very important. Noninvasive in vivo diabetes-diagnosis procedures are very new and require thorough studies to be error-resistant and user-friendly. In this study, we compare two noninvasive procedures (two-wavelength- and three-wavelength-based methods) to estimate glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in different scenarios and evaluate them with error level calculations. The three-wavelength method, which has more model parameters, results in a more accurate estimation of HbA1c even when the blood oxygenation (SpO(2)) values change. The HbA1c-estimation error range of the two-wavelength model, due to change in SpO(2), is found to be from -1.306% to 0.047%. On the other hand, the HbA1c estimation error for the three-wavelength model is found to be in the magnitude of 10(-14)% and independent of SpO(2). The approximation of SpO(2) from the two-wavelength model produces a lower error for the molar concentration based technique (-4% to -1.9% at 70% to 100% of reference SpO(2)) as compared to the molar absorption coefficient based technique. Additionally, the two-wavelength model is less susceptible to sensor noise levels (max SD of %error, 0.142%), as compared to the three-wavelength model (max SD of %error, 0.317%). Despite having a higher susceptibility to sensor noise, the three-wavelength model can estimate HbA1c values more accurately; this is because it takes the major components of blood into account and thus becomes a more realistic model.",,,,,"Haque, Chowdhury Azimul/JJF-2401-2023; Hossain, M Shifat/ISR-8499-2023","Hossain, M Shifat/0000-0002-4537-2620; Haque, Chowdhury Azimul/0000-0002-3947-1454",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3417,,,,AUG,2021,11,15,,,,,,,6867,10.3390/app11156867,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11156867,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000681946900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Continuous monitoring systems allow subjects to prepare the diabetes management strategy and prevent the long-term complications diseases. Until now, most studies utilize various biofluids such as sweat, tears and saliva that have serious unresolved setback such as expensive material, sensor stability, sensor calibration and long-settling time. Therefore, we developed a novel BG sensor which is cost efficient and highly wearable with a small data acquisition time window that allow a non-invasive, long-term continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) system. The novel biosensor exploits a unique information of the pulsatile to continuous components of the arterial blood volume pulsation during the change of blood glucose (BG) concentration at the wrist tissue. The reflected optical signal was measured in the combine visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. An in-vivo experiment which enclosed 12 volunteers in a two-hour modified carbohydrate-rich meals reached the average correlation coefficient (R-p) between the estimated and reference BG concentration of 0.86, with the standard prediction error (SPE) of 6.16 mg/dl.

In this study we explored the utility of post-prandial vascular stiffness as a surrogate measure for estimating insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic condition. Approach. A cohort of 51 healthy young adults with varying body mass index (BMI) values was studied using fasting plasma values of insulin and glucose, fasting and post-meal finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance 2 (HOMA-IR2) using fasting plasma insulin and glucose. Vascular stiffness was estimated by reciprocal of pulse arrival time (rPAT) from ECG and finger PPG at five time points from fasting to 2 h post-oral glucose ingestion. We examined if insulin resistance correlates with meal-induced vascular stiffness changes, supporting the feasibility of using finger PPG to estimate insulin resistance. Main results. HOMA-IR2 was positively correlated with an early rise (0 to 30 min post-meal) and delayed fall (30 to 120 min post-meal) of rPAT. Correlation persisted even after the effect of BMI has been partialled out in subgroup analysis. We conclude that finger PPG-based pulse waveform and single-lead ECG has the potential to be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of insulin resistance. Significance.

In contrast to the conventional power generation mode, when the current response is generated upon continuous short-circuiting, the suggested pulse regime is fulfilled by periodic opening and shorting of the circuit. Despite PB being electroactive, the pulse readout is advantageous over conventional steady-state power generation, providing up to a 15-fold increased signal-to-background ratio as well as dramatically improved sensitivity exceeding 10 A center dot M-1 center dot cm-2 for H2O2 sensors and 3.9 A center dot M-1 center dot cm-2 for glucose biosensors. Such analytical performance characteristics are, most probably, achieved due to the enrichment of the diffusion layer by analyte mass transfer from the bulk upon opening of the circuit.

Atherosclerosis may occur in both lower and upper peripheral arteries, causing progressive dialysis access stenosis in HD patients. To assess the risk of PAD, non-invasive bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) can be used to obtain continuous variations in blood flow volume in in vivo examinations. The authors propose an astable multivibrator to model the peripheral circulation system and to produce PPG oscillation with time constants, duty ratio (rising time), and amplitude ratio of systolic and diastolic pressures. Then, the bilateral differences in the time constant and duty ratio are used to separate the normal condition from PAD. The machine learning decision-making process utilises a screening method to automatically detect subjects with and without the risk of PAD. The radial-based function is employed to parameterise the similarity and dissimilarity levels using probability values.

The PPG waveform comprises a pulsatile ('AC') physiological waveform attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heart beat, and is superimposed on a slowly varying ('DC') baseline with various lower frequency components attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity and thermoregulation. Although the origins of the components of the PPG signal are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that they can provide valuable information about the cardiovascular system. There has been a resurgence of interest in the technique in recent years, driven by the demand for low cost, simple and portable technology for the primary care and community based clinical settings, the wide availability of low cost and small semiconductor components, and the advancement of computer-based pulse wave analysis techniques.

Since the learning of discriminative features from video physiological representations is quite challenging, we propose a token feature fusion block to fuse the multi-view fine-grained representations to a union discrete frequency space. A causal net is used to analyze the fused higher-order information, so that the framework can be enforced to disentangle the latent factors into the related endogenous association that corresponds to down-stream fusion information to improve the semantic interpretation.

Second derivative related indices of PPG (for RED LED and IR LED) were calculated. Materials and methods: Study was carried out on 15 healthy female subjects without any known history of blood pressure and blood glucose; aged between 19-23 years. Results and conclusion: Amplitude of PPG obtained from RED LED is smaller than the amplitude of PPG obtained from IR LED. Comparative analysis of first and second derivative of the PPG obtained from RED light source and IR light source is discussed by the authors. It was observed that various parameters studied from second derivative are the 'Normalized Values', so effect of change in the amplitude of the PPG signal obtained from RED LED and IR LED get nullified in this study (P>0.05). Though IR source based reflective type of sensor related study can be useful in future for the brain vascular health assessment.",,,,,"Shriram, Revati/H-9766-2015; MAHALINGAM, SUNDHARARAJAN/A-6686-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0970-938X,0976-1683,,,,,2016,27,,,,SI,,S454,S459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000393477900025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Type 2 diabetes is associated with the involvement of both small vessels and large vessels. Studies on the relevance of baPWV to early diabetic nephropathy are scarce. This retrospective observational case-control study enrolled 120 patients with type 2 diabetes from our medical records. We classified patients into two groups depending on the magnitude of albuminuria: 60 patients with microalbuminuria were classified as the early diabetic nephropathy group (EDN group) and 60 patients without albuminuria were classified as the diabetes without nephropathy group (DWN group). An additional 30 nondiabetic age- and sex-matched controls were also enrolled. Data regarding the lipid profile, blood pressure, baPWV, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, anthropometric measurements, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), serum creatinine level, and glycemic control indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c)) were recorded for all enrolled participants. baPWV was significantly higher in the EDN group than in the DWN group. Moreover, baPWV was positively correlated with age, duration of diabetes, obesity, poor glycemic control, and high serum levels of triglycerides (TG), hs-CRP, creatinine, and uric acid as well as a high UACR (all P<0.01). A significant negative correlation was found between baPWV and high-density lipoprotein levels (P<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the hs-CRP level and duration of diabetes most strongly influenced baPWV. baPWV may be a convenient, noninvasive, and reproducible method for detecting early diabetic nephropathy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2314-6745,2314-6753,,,,9-Feb,2021,2021,,,,,,,,8862573,10.1155/2021/8862573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/8862573,,,,,,,,33628837,,,,,WOS:000620973200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Upper extremity vascular disease (UEVD) and atherosclerosis are high-risk PADs for patients with Type 2 diabetes or with both diabetes and end-stage renal disease. For early UEVD detection, a fingertip-based, toe-based, or wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) tool is a simple and noninvasive measurement system for vital sign monitoring and healthcare applications. Based on time-domain PPG analysis, a Duffing-Holmes system with a master system and a slave system is used to extract self-synchronization dynamic errors, which can track the differences in PPG morphology (in amplitudes (systolic peak) and time delay (systolic peak to diastolic peak)) between healthy subjects and PAD patients. In the preliminary analysis, the self-synchronization dynamic errors can be used to evaluate risk levels based on the reflection index (RI), which includes normal condition, lower PAD, and higher PAD. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is established as a multilayer classifier for automatic UEVD screening. The experimental results indicated that the self-synchronization dynamic errors have a positive correlation with the RI (R-2 = 0.6694).

Valid and reliable noninvasive tests such as the ankle-brachial index (ABI) are recommended to detect LEAD. However, ABI results can be inconclusive or the index can be elevated (ie, >1.3) in persons with calcified ankle arteries due to DM, renal failure, or arthritis. In these instances, obtaining toe pressure (TP) measurements, which correlate well with angiographic findings, is advised, providing the patient does not have vasoconstriction with cold toes or vasospastic disease. In such cases, TP can be obtained using a portable photoplethysmograph (PPG), which offers a simple and inexpensive method for healthcare providers in a variety of clinical settings to assess for the presence of LEAD. Portable PPG TP measurements have been found to have a high level of agreement with vascular laboratory PPG tests to detect LEAD, as well as good sensitivity and a high specificity.

Theoretically, it can eliminate the individual differences of static tissues such as skin and muscle and the influence of measurement conditions on measurement accuracy, and realize high-precision noninvasive blood component analysis. Obtaining the dynamic spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio is the key to modeling and analysis. To further improve the quality of the dynamic spectrum and ensure the robustness of the model, this paper proposes an optimized single-trail extraction method, which is improved for the main single-trail extraction method at present. In this method, the sampling points deviating from the fitting line in the rising edge signal of photo-plethysmography (PPG) are eliminated by statistical method many times and using the superposition average of the slope between each sampling point on the rising edge to obtain the high-quality DS. To verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, we collected the spectral PPG data of the near-infrared trans-mission of the fingers of 231 volunteers, the wavelength range was 591.8 nm-1100 nm, and the hemoglobin concentration range of the total sample was 90-176 g / L, then used the optimized single-trail extraction method and the single-trail extraction method to extract DS from the spectral PPG data of all samples and divided them into an experimental group and a control group according to the different extraction methods. Two methods of spectral smoothness and modeling analysis were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the spectrum. The experimental data are as follows: when the DS is evaluated with spectral smoothness as an index, the mean square error of the experimental group's spectrum is reduced from 0.011 to 0.0059, which is 53.6 % of the control group; and when using the least partial squares method to establish a hemoglobin model for prediction, compared with the control group, the related coefficient of the correction set (Rc) in the experimental group reached 0.91, an increase of 7.96 %, and the root mean square error of the correction set (RMSEC) of the calibration set decreased to 5.63g/L, decreased by 22.17 %, the related coefficient of the prediction set (Rp) reached 0.86, increased by 10.90 %, and the root mean square error of the prediction set (RMSEP) decreased to 6.27g/L, decreased by 19.76 %. The experimental results show that the optimized single-trail extraction method proposed in this paper improves the spectral smoothness and modeling effect compared with the original single -trail extraction method effectively improving the quality of DS.

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions: This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future.",,,,,"Househ, Mowafa/GPX-8430-2022; Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa/ABE-3043-2021; Househ, Mowafa/GPX-8317-2022","Abd-alrazaq, Alaa/0000-0001-7695-4626; Aziz, Sarah/0000-0002-0861-9743; Househ, Mowafa/0000-0002-3648-6271; Sheikh, Javaid/0000-0002-5762-4186; Ahmed, Arfan/0000-0002-4025-5767",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,14-Mar,2023,25,,,,,,,,e40259,10.2196/40259,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/40259,,,,,,,,36917147,,,,,WOS:001026019500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hierarchical clustering technology recombines the decomposed BG series according to their sample entropy and the correlations with the original BG trends. Dynamic BG trends are regressed separately for each recombined BG series by the GRU model to realize the more precise estimations, which are optimized by IBFO for its structure and superparameters. Through experiments, the optimized and basic LSTM, RNN, and support vector regression (SVR) are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the 15-min IBFO-GRU prediction is improved on average by about 13.1% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with those of the RNN and LSTM optimized by IBFO.

To measure oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians at different stages of development of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. Plasma total 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), an indicator of oxidative stress, was determined in age-matched subjects with normal glucose metabolism (n = 39), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 14), newly diagnosed diabetes (n = a) and established diabetes (n = 14). Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and 2 h following an oral glucose tolerance test. Endothelial function was assessed by non-invasive digital pulse wave photoplethysmography. Results. Plasma 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) increased in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) compared with control subjects, and was even higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.01) diabetic patients. A tendency towards reduced endothelial function in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance became significant in patients with newly diagnosed and established diabetes (p < 0.01), and was correlated with 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha) (r=0.36, p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) did not change in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with control subjects, but increased in newly diagnosed (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.001) diabetic subjects.

However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques.

This method is based on the combination of the conservationof- energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples.

Since HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding three months, it is unaffected by a patient's activity level or diet before a test. Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complications associated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography is helpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths (615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two different ratio calibrations were applied and their performances were compared to a work that used three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson's r values for HbA1c estimates were 0.896 and 0.905, considering the ratio calibrations for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibration in addition to the ratio calibrations, we could improve this performance such that the Pearson's r values of the HbA1c levels were 0.929 and 0.930 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. In a previous study, using three wavelengths, the Pearson's r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Here, the RCF of the SpO(2) estimation was 0.986 when the SpO(2) ratio calibration was applied, while in a previous study, the RCF values of the SpO(2) estimation were 0.983 and 0.986 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively.

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective: This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results: From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions: This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes.",,,,,"Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa/ABE-3043-2021","Sheikh, Javaid/0000-0002-5762-4186; Abd-alrazaq, Alaa/0000-0001-7695-4626; Ahmed, Arfan/0000-0002-4025-5767; Aziz, Sarah/0000-0002-0861-9743",,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-8871,,,,,22-Aug,2022,24,8,,,,,,,e36010,10.2196/36010,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/36010,,,,,,,,35943772,,,,,WOS:000862887800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To improve the measurement signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy, using a polarization camera as the sensor, this paper proposes a multi-wavelength dynamic optical rotation angle method to quantitatively analyze human blood glucose. First, this paper utilizes a split-time approach to drive nine different wavelengths of light sources to work separately to achieve the collection of multiple different wavelengths of data and increase the amount of information. Second, to capture images with an array sensor such as a camera, using space-for-accuracy, this paper uses the cumulative value of the gray values of all pixel points in the image at each angle as the light intensity value to improve the amplitude (light intensity) resolution. Third, the extraction method of the dynamic optical rotation angle in this paper is to extract the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the optical rotation angle from each cycle of the signal of the continuous cyclic change of the length of the optical path, and the accumulated value of the difference of multiple cycles is recorded as the dynamic optical rotation angle, which not only reduces the errors caused by the individual differences, the external environment and the measuring instrument, but also has the effect of averaging and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical rotation angle. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, human finger real and simulation experiments are carried out, respectively. Firstly, the polarization camera is used to collect the image data of elliptically polarized light of nine different wavelengths of linearly polarized light after passing through the human body's finger, and obtains the optical rotation angle under each wavelength that changes with the photoplethysmography (PPG) through data processing, and extracts the dynamic optical rotation angles of the nine wavelengths by the extraction method, and the human body's blood glucose can be quantitatively analyzed. Secondly, this paper builds a simulation model to simulate the blood volume conversion of the human finger, and uses the simulation experimental system to collect the dynamic optical rotation angles of nine wavelengths of a total of 137 human serum samples, and uses partial least squares regression to establish a model between the dynamic optical rotation angles and blood glucose concentration. In the results of predicting all samples using the model, the correlation coefficient and root mean square error were 0.7960 and 2.16 mmol/L, respectively, both of which improved by 137.26% and decreased by 35.33 %, respectively, compared to the existing method. The experimental results show that the method in this paper has high accuracy in detecting the blood glucose concentration in human beings, which is of great significance in realizing the noninvasive quantitative analysis of human blood glucose components by the polarized light method.",,,,,,"SANG, MEI/0000-0001-7120-0980",,,,,,,,,,,,,0263-2241,1873-412X,,,,JAN,2025,242,,C,,,,,,116008,10.1016/j.measurement.2024.116008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2024.116008,,Oct-24,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001348135600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The non-contact measurement method can avoid these problems. In this paper, a non-contact blood glucose detection method based on a near-infrared camera is proposed. Blood glucose has a strong absorption capacity in the near-infrared band, and other components in blood (water, he-moglobin, etc.) have different absorption characteristics in this band compared with blood glucose. Therefore, in this method, we realize blood glucose detection by receiving the near-infrared light reflected back after blood glucose absorption. We extracted 26 pulse wave features from the pulse wave and analyzed 6 that were highly correlated with blood glucose. Then, four kinds of machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLS, SVR, RFR) were used to build models respectively, and the RFR with the best performance was selected to build the final blood glucose prediction model.

However, the optical absorption change induced by blood glucose is weak in the NIR region and often masked by interference from other components such as water and hemoglobin. Aim Instead of using direct optical absorption by glucose, this study proposes an index calculated from oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals that shows a good correlation with BGLs while using conventional visible and NIR spectroscopy. Approach The metabolic index, which is based on tissue oxygen consumption, was derived through analytical methods and further verified and reproduced in a series of glucose challenge experiments. Blood glucose estimation units were prototyped by utilizing commercially available smart devices. Results Our experimental results showed that the phase delay between the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals in near-infrared spectroscopy correlates with BGL measured by a conventional continuous glucose monitor. The proposed method was also confirmed to work well with visible spectroscopy systems based on smartphone cameras. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent repeatability in results from a total of 19 oral challenge tests. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of non-invasive glucose monitoring using existing photoplethysmography sensors for pulse oximeters and smartwatches. Evaluating the proposed method in diabetic or unhealthy individuals may serve to further increase its practicality. (c) The Authors.

To overcome these long-standing problems, we largely enhanced the training efficiency with the limited personal data by an innovative Deduction Learning (DL), instead of the conventional Induction Learning (IL). The domain theory of our deductive method, DL, made use of accumulated comparison of paired inputs leading to corrections to preceded measured blood glucose to construct our deep neural network architecture. DL method involves the use of paired adjacent rounds of finger pulsation Photoplethysmography signal recordings as the input to a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) based deep learning model. Our study reveals that CNN filters of DL model generated extra and non-uniform feature patterns than that of IL models, which suggests DL is superior to IL in terms of learning efficiency under limited training data. Among 30 diabetic patients as our recruited volunteers, DL model achieved 80% of test prediction in zone A of Clarke Error Grid (CEG) for model training with 12 rounds of data, which was 20% improvement over IL method.

Methods: Totally, 111 subjects (70 healthy and 41 diabetic) were recruited. Demographic, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. Blood was collected for determining serum cholesterol, total triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. Arterial stiffness was assessed with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, crest time and inter-digital volume pulse differences. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated high inter-digital volume pulse difference sensitivity to glycated haemoglobin level over 6.5%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated significant correlation between inter-digital volume pulse difference and electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity (r=0.692, p<0.001). Compared with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, inter-digital volume pulse difference exhibited highly significant correlations with age, glycated haemoglobin level, pulse pressure, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, crest time, high-density lipoprotein and systolic blood pressure (all ps<0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated successful application of a novel non-invasive waveform contour index, inter-digital volume pulse difference, in differentiating young from aged subjects and patients with good diabetic control from those with poor diabetic control but also validated its use in identifying arteriosclerosis risks. The results, therefore, endorse its domestic application as non-invasive tool for arteriosclerosis risk screening.",,,,,"Wu, Hsien-Tsai/X-4730-2019; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan/K-5723-2012","Wu, Hsientsai/0000-0002-2581-9384",,,,,,,,,,,,,1479-1641,1752-8984,,,,MAY,2017,14,3,,,,,254,257,,10.1177/1479164116688870,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1479164116688870,,,,,,,,28467197,,,,,WOS:000400686700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, these four channel PPGs form a quaternion valued signal. Then, the quaternion valued means and the quaternion valued medians of this quaternion valued PPGs are employed as features. Next, the quaternion valued long short term memory (QLSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed for estimating the non-invasive blood glucose values. Unlike the traditional methods based on extracting the features in each channel of the PPGs independently and fusing all the features together in the conventional neural networks, the quaternion valued operations performed on the quaternion valued PPGs only fuse the same features among these four channels together while do not fuse different features among these four channels together. Hence, the physical interpretations of the features preserve. To demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed method, two datasets are evaluated. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can yield 81.43% and 83.09% of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clark error grid for the test data in the first dataset and in the second dataset, respectively. Also, it can yield the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) at 14.41% and 14.31% for the test data in the first dataset and the second dataset, respectively. This demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method over the existing methods for the test data in the both datasets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1746-8094,1746-8108,,,,APR,2025,102,,,,,,,,107267,10.1016/j.bspc.2024.107267,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2024.107267,,Dec-24,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001416984600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

M.",,,Small intra-individual variability of the pre-ejection period justifies the use of pulse transit time as approximation of the vascular transit,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Vascular transit time (VTT) is the propagation time of a pulse wave through an artery; it is a measure for arterial stiffness. Because reliable non-invasive VTT measurements are difficult, as an alternative we measure pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is defined as the time between the R-wave on electrocardiogram and arrival of the resulting pulse wave in a distal location measured with photoplethysmography (PPG). The time between electrical activation of the ventricles and the resulting pulse wave after opening of the aortic valve is called the pre-ejection period (PEP), a component of PTT. The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of PEP at rest, to establish how accurate PTT is as approximation of VTT. Methods PTT was measured and PEP was assessed with echocardiography (gold standard) in three groups of 20 volunteers: 1) a control group without cardiovascular disease aged <50 years and 2) aged >50 years, and 3) a group with cardiovascular risk factors, defined as arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, kidney failure and diabetes mellitus. Results Per group, the mean PEP was: 1) 58.5 +/- 13.0 ms, 2) 52.4 +/- 11.9 ms, and 3) 57.6 +/- 11.6 ms. However, per individual the standard deviation was much smaller, i.e. 1) 2.0-5.9 ms, 2) 2.85.1 ms, and 3) 1.6-12.0 ms, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean PEP of the 3 groups (p = 0.236). Conclusion In conclusion, the intra-individual variability of PEP is small. A change in PTT in a person at rest is most probably the result of a change in VTT rather than of PEP. Thus, PTT at rest is an easy, non-invasive and accurate approximation of VTT for monitoring arterial stiffness.",,,,,"Grüne, Frank/G-4869-2018","Kortekaas, Minke/0000-0001-5003-7045",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,10-Oct,2018,13,10,,,,,,,e0204105,10.1371/journal.pone.0204105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204105,,,,,,,,30304059,,,,,WOS:000446921100031,View Full Record in Web of Science

The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity(2). Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the 'primary cohort'), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the 'contemporary cohort') and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the 'clinic cohort'). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750-0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723-0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P <= 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes.

Therefore, it has a high infection risk and the users are suffered from the pain. Moreover, the long term consumable cost is high. Recently, the wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation approach has been proposed. However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the presence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the obtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable. Moreover, different subjects have different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose. To address this issue, a polynomial fitting approach to smooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values has been proposed. In particular, the design of the coefficients in the polynomial is formulated as the various optimisation problems. First, the blood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimisation approaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood glucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimisation approach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each optimisation approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each sorted blood glucose value, the optimisation method corresponding to the minimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate probability of each selected optimisation method is computed. If the accumulate probability of any selected optimisation method at a point is greater than a threshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected optimisation methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted blood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries points being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after performing the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose values in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose values and the corresponding optimisation methods in these regions are determined. It is worth noting that the conventional lowpass denoising method was performed in the signal domain (either in the time domain or in the frequency domain), while the authors' proposed method is performed in the feature space or the reference blood glucose space. Hence, the authors' proposed method can further improve the reliability of the obtained feature values or the reference blood glucose values so as to improve the accuracy of the blood glucose estimation. Moreover, the individual modelling regression method has been employed here to suppress the effects of different users having different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose values. The computer numerical simulation results show that the authors' proposed method yields the mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) at 0.0930 and the percentage of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid at 94.1176%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-8849,1751-8857,,,,JUN,2023,17,3,,,,,107,120,,10.1049/syb2.12063,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/syb2.12063,,Mar-23,,,,,,36999925,,,,,WOS:000961580700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Digital volume pulse acquisition is a convenient method, even for a person with no previous training or experience, can be utilized to estimate the two abovementioned physiological parameters. The physiological basis assumptions are utilized to develop two-finger models for estimating the percent glycated hemoglobin and blood oxygenation levels. The first model consists of a blood-vessel-only hypothesis, whereas the second model is based on a whole-finger model system. The two gray-box systems were validated on diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The mean absolute errors for the percent glycated hemoglobin (%HbA1c) and percent oxygen saturation (%SpO(2)) were 0.375 and 1.676 for the blood-vessel model and 0.271 and 1.395 for the whole-finger model, respectively. The repeatability analysis indicated that these models resulted in a mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) of 2.08% and 1.74% for %HbA1c and 0.54% and 0.49% for %SpO(2) in the respective models. Herein, both models exhibited similar performances (HbA1c estimation Pearson's R values were 0.92 and 0.96, respectively), despite the model assumptions differing greatly. The bias values in the Bland-Altman analysis for both models were - 0.03 +/- 0.458 and - 0.063 +/- 0.326 for HbA1c estimation, and 0.178 +/- 2.002 and - 0.246 +/- 1.69 for SpO2 estimation, respectively.

Furthermore, such old methods need the use of heavy equipment, blood draws, and traditional bench-top testing procedures. Invasive ways of acquiring test samples can potentially cause patient discomfort and anguish. Wearable sensors, on the other hand, may be attached to numerous body areas to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics as a developing analytical tool. Physical, chemical, and biological data transferred via the skin are used to monitor health in various circumstances. Wearable sensors can assess the aberrant conditions of the physical or chemical components of the human body in real time, exposing the body state in time, thanks to unintrusive sampling and high accuracy. Most commercially available wearable gadgets are mechanically hard components attached to bands and worn on the wrist, with form factors ultimately constrained by the size and weight of the batteries required for the power supply. Basic physiological signals comprise a lot of health-related data. The estimation of critical physiological characteristics, such as pulse inconstancy or variability using photoplethysmography (PPG) and oxygen saturation in arterial blood using pulse oximetry, is possible by utilizing an analysis of the pulsatile component of the bloodstream. Wearable gadgets with skin-like qualities are a new type of automation that is only starting to make its way out of research labs and into pre-commercial prototypes. Flexible skin-like sensing devices have accomplished several functionalities previously inaccessible for typical sensing devices due to their deformability, lightness, portability, and flexibility.

Arterial stiffness was measured by DVP photoplethysmography (PCA 2; Micro Medical) using a direct, standardized approach. CVD risk assessment was performed in accordance with the Joint British Society guidelines (JBS2). RESULTS Of our cohort of 247 individuals (51% male; mean age 55.2 (s.d. 10.3) years), 187 were apparently healthy and 60 had established CVD risk factors (diabetes mellitus:33%, hypertension: 77.8%, hypercholesteremia: 61%). On univariate analysis, Sl was strongly associated with CVD risk (the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) based HeartScore) (Pearson correlation coefficient (R): 0.56, P <= 0.001) and increased in an ordinal fashion from low risk to medium risk to high risk to very high risk (pseudo R-2 = 0.30; P < 0.001).

Conventional measures of BRS require expensive or invasive equipment for the beat-to-beat measure of blood pressure (BP). We examined the possibility of developing a simple protocol that would provide a relatively standardized BP stimulus, which might obviate the need to measure BP beat-by-beat. Methods and Results Fifty-five patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 59 [SD 11] years) and 20 healthy control subjects (mean age 53 [SD 14] years, P not significant) underwent 5-minute recordings of BP (by photoplethysmograph) and R-R interval during 0.1.Hz controlled breathing. The size of the oscillations in BP was the same in the 2 groups (3.6 mm Hg vs 4.1 mm Hg, P = .5). There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations (77 ms vs 3 1 ms, P < .000 1). The amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations correlated strongly with BRS (r = 0.8 1, P < .000 1 with controlled breathing BRS, and r = 0.51, P < .0001 with (x index). There was no correlation with the size of BP oscillations (r = -0.13, P not significant with controlled breathing BRS, and r = -0.15, P not significant with alpha index). In a separate study, a group of 22 young patients (mean age 36 years) with type I diabetes mellitus and 28 healthy control subjects (mean age 39 years) underwent measurement of resting HRV and amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during 0.1.Hz breathing. There was no significant difference in triangular index or low-frequency R-R interval power between the 2 groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during controlled breathing between patients with diabetes and healthy control subjects. Total and high-frequency RR interval variability was also significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion During 0.1.Hz breathing, the marked difference in BRS between patients with CHF and age-matched control subjects is the result of smaller R-R interval oscillations. In young patients with diabetes, these R-R interval oscillations are significantly smaller than age-matched control subjects, even when some measures of spontaneous HRV are not different between groups. Breathing at 0.1.Hz provides a standard BP stimulus and concentrates spectral power of heart rate at one frequency, enabling simple evaluation of BRS even when BP measurement is not available.",,,,,"Piepoli, Massimo/J-9437-2016; Stewart Coats, Andrew/E-4451-2012","Piepoli, Massimo/0000-0003-1124-234X; Colhoun, Helen/0000-0002-8345-3288; Stewart Coats, Andrew/0000-0002-2771-4260; Davies, Ceri/0000-0001-7239-2996",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8703,1097-6744,,,,MAR,2002,143,3,,,,,441,447,,10.1067/mhj.2002.121263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1067/mhj.2002.121263,,,,,,,,11868049,,,,,WOS:000174265600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skill perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured. Methods: Measurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning. Results: There was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P < .01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P < .01 in both cases).

At the same time, for distances above 2.4 mm, the sensor becomes sensitive to muscle blood content, which decreases the specificity to skin perfusion monitoring. Thus, the SDDs in the range from 1.5 mm to 2.4 mm satisfy the requirements of sensor sensitivity and specificity. The hardware implementation of the system has been realized and tested in laboratory experiments with a venous occlusion procedure and in an outpatient clinical study in 16 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. For both testing procedures, the optical sensor demonstrated high sensitivity to perfusion change provoking events. The general build-up of cutaneous blood under the sensor has been observed which can be associated with pressure-induced vasodilation as a response to the sensor application.",,,,,"Zakharov, Pavel/A-3537-2009; Talary, Mark/K-5473-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9155,1361-6560,,,,7-Sep,2009,54,17,,,,,5301,5320,,10.1088/0031-9155/54/17/015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/54/17/015,,,,,,,,19687533,,,,,WOS:000269074500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The SDPTG indices (b/a and d/a) were calculated from the height of the wave components. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the independent determinants of an increased b/a (highest quartile of the b/a) were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval (CI]: 1.09-1.15), hypertension (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.03-2.65), dyslipidemia (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09), impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.16-5.07), and a lack of regular exercise (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.29-3.08).

PAD is common; it is estimated to affect 236 million individuals worldwide. Advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and concomitant cardiovascular disease are common factors associated with increased risk of PAD. Complications of PAD can include claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore clinically important to use diagnostic tests that accurately identify PAD. Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression or intervene when indicated. Toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are amongst a suite of non-invasive bedside tests used to detect PAD. Both TBI and TSBP are commonly utilised by a variety of clinicians in different settings, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy is warranted and highly relevant to inform clinical practice. Objectives To (1) estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities. Secondary objectives were to investigate several possible sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including the following: patient group tested (people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with renal disease and general population), type of equipment used, positivity threshold and type of reference standard. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc and DARE databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 27 February 2024. Selection criteria We included diagnostic case-control, cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective studies in which all participants had either a TSBP or TBI measurement plus a validated method of vascular diagnostic imaging for PAD. We needed to be able to cross-tabulate (2 x 2 table) results of the index test and the reference standard to include a study. To be included, study populations had to be adults aged 18 years and over. We included studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Studies had to use TSBP and TBI (also called toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI)), either individually, or in addition to other non-invasive tests as index tests to diagnose PAD in individuals with suspected disease. We included data collected by photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and manual or automated digital equipment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently completed data extraction using a standardised form. We extracted data to populate 2 x 2 contingency tables when available (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Where data were not available to enable statistical analysis, we contacted study authors directly. Two review authors working independently undertook quality assessment using QUADAS-2, with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We incorporated two additional questions into the quality appraisal to aid our understanding of the conduct of studies and make appropriate judgements about risk of bias and applicability. Main results Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. Thirteen of the studies used colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) as a reference standard, two used computed tomography angiography (CTA), one used multi-detector row tomography (MDCT), one used angiography and one used a combination of CDU, CTA and angiography. TBI was investigated in 1927 participants and 2550 limbs. TSBP was investigated in 701 participants, of which 701 limbs had TSBP measured. Studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard. The certainty of evidence according to GRADE for most studies was very low. Authors' conclusions Whilst a small number of diagnostic test accuracy studies have been completed for TBI and TSBP to identify PAD, the overall methodological quality was low, with most studies providing a very low certainty of evidence. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is therefore limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. Future research using robust methods and clear reporting is warranted to comprehensively determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the TBI and TSBP for identification of PAD with greater certainty. However, conducting such research where some of the reference tests are invasive and only clinically indicated in populations with known PAD is challenging.",,,,,"Oldmeadow, Chris/HKF-3685-2023; Tehan, Peta/H-7080-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1469-493X,1361-6137,,,,,2024,,10,,,,,,,CD013783,10.1002/14651858.CD013783.pub2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013783.pub2,,,,,,,,39474992,,,,,WOS:001406524900008,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Tusman, G; Bohm, SH; Suarez-Sipmann, F",,,,"Tusman, Gerardo; Bohm, Stephan H.; Suarez-Sipmann, Fernando",,,Advanced Uses of Pulse Oximetry for Monitoring Mechanically Ventilated Patients,ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pulse oximetry is an undisputable standard of care in clinical monitoring. It combines a spectrometer to detect hypoxemia with a plethysmograph for the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up of cardiovascular diseases. These pulse oximetry capabilities are extremely useful for assessing the respiratory and circulatory status and for monitoring of mechanically ventilated patients. On the one hand, the key spectrography-derived function of pulse oximetry is to evaluate a patient's gas exchange that results from a particular ventilatory treatment by continuously and noninvasively measuring arterial hemoglobin saturation (Spo(2)). This information helps to maintain patients above the hypoxemic levels, leading to appropriate ventilator settings and inspired oxygen fractions. However, whenever higher than normal oxygen fractions are used, Spo(2) can mask existing oxygenation defects in ventilated patients. This limitation, resulting from the S shape of the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve, can be overcome by reducing the oxygen fraction delivered to the patient in a controlled and stepwise manner. This results in a Spo(2)/Fio(2) diagram, which allows a rough characterization of a patient's gas exchange, shunt, and the amount of lung area with a low ventilation/perfusion ratio without the need of blood sampling. On the other hand, the photoplethysmography-derived oximeter function has barely been exploited for the purpose of monitoring hemodynamics in mechanically ventilated patients. The analysis of the photoplethysmography contour provides useful real-time and noninvasive information about the interaction of heart and lungs during positive pressure ventilation. These hemodynamic monitoring capabilities are related to both the assessment of preload dependency mainly by analyzing the breath-by-breath variation of the photoplethysmographic signals and the analysis of arterial impedance, Which examines the changes in the plethysmographic amplitude, contour, and derived indexes. In this article, we present and describe these extended monitoring capabilities and propose a more holistic monitoring concept that takes advantage of these advanced uses of pulse oximetry in the monitoring of ventilated patients. Today's monitors need to be improved if such novel functionalities were to be offered for clinical use. Future developments and clinical evaluations are needed to establish the true potential of these advanced monitoring uses of pulse oximetry.",,,,,"Sipmann, Fernando/AAD-9104-2020","Suarez-Sipmann, Fernando/0000-0002-7412-2970",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-2999,,,,,JAN,2017,124,1,,,,,62,71,,10.1213/ANE.0000000000001283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000001283,,,,,,,,27183375,,,,,WOS:000390613500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this method becomes less reliable in the presence of calcified, incompressible arteries, as they result in an erroneously elevated ABI, and an additional measure termed the toe-brachial index (TBI) is recommended. The evaluation of ABI, and in particular TBI, typically requires significant technical skill and often involves referral to a vascular laboratory. This present situation reveals the need for a valid and reliable, automatic, noninvasive device that will provide both ABI and TBI at the level of the primary care physician. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of such a device, the Vasera VS-1500AT, in the assessment of toe, ankle, and brachial systolic blood pressures. Materials and methods This study involved the assessment of 80 limbs from 40 normotensive and hypertensive individuals (17 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 45 +/- 18 years. Results There was a statistically significant correlation (r=0.92) between toe systolic blood pressures obtained manually with photoplethysmography compared with those obtained through the automated device. The same significant correlation was also seen between the two with ankle (r=0.87) and brachial (r=0.88) systolic blood pressures. Conclusion These strong correlations demonstrate that further investigation of this device is warranted regarding its use as a screening tool for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. The automation provided by this device could potentially eliminate variability in these measurements thereby allowing for screening and diagnosis to be done without referral to a vascular laboratory.

To compare high-resolution ultrasound of major arteries and the method of vascular stiffness evaluation by digital volume pulse photoplethysmography after sublingual nitroglycerin in diagnosis of structural vascular changes. Material and methods. The comparison of the two methods was made in 110 volunteers (mean age 31.9 +/- 11.5 years). The study protocol included measurement of blood pressure (BP), blood lipids and glucose, evaluation of IMT of the carotid arteries by ultrasonography, baseline stiffness index (SIbl) and after sublingual nitroglycerin (SIng) by photoplethysmography. Reproducibility of photoplethysmography was evaluated in 20 volunteers (mean age 20.3 +/- 1.4 years) with repeated measurement after 1 week. The results were tested in 40 volunteers of different age groups. Results. There were significant correlations of IMT, SIN and SIng with risk factors and close interrelations of these parameters. SIng better explained variability of IMT compared to SIN (r = 0. 79, R-2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 001 versus r = 0. 67, R-2 = 0. 45, p < 0. 001, respectively). Relations of LUT with risk factors were lost after correction for SIng. Reproducibility of SIng was higher than SIN ( +/- 5.1 % versus +/- 10.9%, respectively) and than those for IMT found in the literature. Mean LUT values for random sample evaluated by ultrasonography and calculated by estimated equation of linear regression for SIng and IMT did not differ significantly (0.576 +/- 0.087 mm versus 0.570 +/- 0.074 mm, p = 0.44; r = 0. 71, p < 0. 001, mean difference 0. 007 +/- 0.051 mm).

Methods Twenty-two antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) patients and 66 age-, sex-, height-, and blood pressure-matched controls were evaluated. Second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) was used as a noninvasive method to evaluate the pulse wave. The b/a and d/a indices, which reflect, respectively, large-vessel and small-vessel properties, were calculated from the SDPTG waveform components. Vascular age index was also determined. Results Arterial thrombosis occurred in 59.1% (13/22) of APL patients, with a predominance of stroke episodes (61.5%). Venous thromboembolism was observed in 36.4% (all deep venous thrombosis), and obstetric complications in 36.4%. Frequency of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia was comparable in APL patients and control subjects (P > 0.05). Concerning plethysmography findings, b/a ratio was higher in patients than in control subjects (-0.44 0.16 vs. -0.54 +/- 0.18, P = 0.034), whereas d/a ratio (-0.30 +/- 0.16 vs. -0.31 +/- 0.18, P = 0.83) was comparable. Moreover, SDPTG (-0.16 +/- 0.35 vs. -0.30 +/- 0.38, P = 0.16) and vascular age index values (53.5 +/- 11.6 vs. 51.8 +/- 16.1, P = 0.65) were alike in both groups. Regarding disease-related factors, patients with arterial and venous thrombosis had similar b/a, d/a, and vascular age indices (P = 0.95; P = 0.06; P = 0.12, respectively). Conclusions The higher b/a ratio in APL patients suggests decreased distensibility of large arteries and may be why APL patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular events. The d/a ratio, that is considered a marker of small vessel vascular resistance, was not different than controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate vascular factors that predispose APL patients to atherosclerotic events.",,,,,"Bortolotto, Luiz/S-1940-2017; de Carvalho, Jozelio/Z-3012-2019; Bonfa, Eloisa/B-8438-2012","Bonfa, Eloisa/0000-0002-0520-4681; de Carvalho, Jozelio/0000-0002-7957-0844",,,,,,,,,,,,,1076-1608,1536-7355,,,,JAN,2018,24,1,,,,,14,17,,10.1097/RHU.0000000000000618,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/RHU.0000000000000618,,,,,,,,29200023,,,,,WOS:000419406200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and pWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complier device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 +/- 4 m/sec v 12.4 +/- 2 m/sec, P < .001), PTG AUI (0.322 +/- 0.16 v 0.252 +/- 0.09, P < .001), and SDPTG AI (-0.093 +/- 0.03 v -0.271 +/- 0.018, P < .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients >60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG Al by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives.

It is a preferential target for critical comorbidities (overweight, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease). Movement and activity are consistently regarded as beneficial, but the related adaptive physiology is still poorly understood. Our goal was to better identify the foot microcirculatory changes after a regular walking gait activity in healthy subjects of different ages. Methods: Twelve healthy participants of both sexes, with normal BMI and Ankle-Brachial Index, were selected and grouped according to age - group I (21.0 +/- 1 y.o.) and group II (55.8 +/- 3 y.o.). The protocol involved 2 phases of 5-min duration each - phase 1, a static standing position, and phase 2, 5-min walking with a comfortable pace on a pre-established circuit. Perfusion changes were assessed in the dorsal region of both feet before (baseline, phase 1) and after (phase 2) the gait period by noninvasive optical technologies - laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), photoplethysmography, and polarized spectroscopy (PSp). Comparative statistics were performed with a 95% confidence level. Results: All instruments detected an asymmetric nonsignificant perfusion between right and left feet during rest in all participants with values in females consistently lower than men. Older participants exhibited lower baseline values than the younger group. Gait evoked a perfusion reduction in all participants relative to phase 1 detected with all technologies, with statistically significant changes recorded with LDF (group I, p = 0.033, and group II, p = 0.028) and PSp (group II, p = 0.041). Furthermore, LDF revealed that gait significantly reduced perfusion velocity in the older group (p = 0.003). Corresponding changes in the younger group were present but discrete. Recovery to baseline levels was also slower in the older group. Discussion/Conclusions: Our results confirm that perfusion is age dependent and demonstrate the clinical relevance of simple dynamic activities such as gait. This reduction of the dorsal foot perfusion occurs in depth, being more pronounced with the movement intensity, suggesting a wide application potential in early diagnostics as for rehabilitation.",,,,,"Florindo, Margarida/ADQ-8405-2022; MRodrigues, L/AAM-6463-2020; Loureiro Nuno, Sérgio/HJH-7696-2023","Florindo, Margarida/0000-0003-2466-6942; Monteiro Rodrigues, Luis/0000-0003-0198-7671",,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-5527,1660-5535,,,,JAN,2022,35,1,,,,,13,22,,10.1159/000517906,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000517906,,,,,,,,34153970,,,,,WOS:000848166100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study group included 203 convalescents aged 60.0 (55.0-63.0) and 115 (56.7%) women. The ASCVD risk was assessed as low to moderate to very high based on medical history (for 62 participants with pre-existing ASCVD/diabetes/chronic kidney disease in the entire cohort) or calculated in percentages using the Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) algorithm based on age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure (BP), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for 141 healthy participants). The stiffness index (SI) and reflection index (RI) measured by photoplethysmography, as well as pulse pressure (PP), calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BP, were markers of arterial stiffness. Stiffness parameters increased significantly with the increase in ASCVD risk in the entire cohort. In 30 (14.8%) patients in the low- to moderate-risk group, the median SI was 8.07 m/s (7.10-8.73), RI 51.40% (39.40-65.60), and PP 45.50 mmHg (40.00-57.00); in 111 (54.7%) patients in the high-risk group, the median SI was 8.70 m/s (7.40-10.03), RI 57.20% (43.65-68.40), and PP 54.00 mmHg (46.00-60.75); and in 62 (30.5%) patients in the very-high-risk group, the median was SI 9.27 m/s (7.57-10.44), RI 59.00% (50.40-72.40), and PP 60.00 mmHg (51.00-67.00). In healthy participants, the SI <= 9.0 m/s (sensitivity of 92.31%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.686, p < 0.001) based on the receiver operating characteristics was the most sensitive variable for discriminating low to moderate risk, and PP > 56.0 mmHg (sensitivity of 74.36%, AUC 0.736, p < 0.001) was used for discriminating very high risk. In multivariate logistic regression, younger age, female sex, PP <= 50 mmHg, SI <= 9.0 m/s, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL had the best relationship with low to moderate SCORE2 risk. In turn, older age, currently smoking, PP > 56.0 mmHg, RI > 68.6%, and diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg were related to very high SCORE2 risk. In conclusion, arterial stiffness is significantly related to ASCVD risk in post-COVID-19 patients and can be helpful as a single risk marker in everyday practice. Cut-off points for arterial stiffness parameters determined based on SCORE2 may help make individual decisions about implementing lifestyle changes or pharmacological treatment of ASCVD risk factors",,,,,"Nowacka-Chmielewska, Marta/AAQ-1179-2020; Loboda, Danuta/HKP-2290-2023; Golba, Krzysztof/GZM-7192-2022","Loboda, Danuta/0000-0003-2932-6269; Lejawa, Mateusz/0000-0002-1228-7534; Sarecka-Hujar, Beata/0000-0003-0002-8591; Golba, Krzysztof/0000-0001-5722-7976; Nowacka-Chmielewska, Marta/0000-0001-8668-8878",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-1729,,,,SEP,2024,14,9,,,,,,,1105,10.3390/life14091105,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life14091105,,,,,,,,39337889,,,,,WOS:001326298100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In study 1, ascending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean+/-SD age of 54+/-11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 mu g angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40+/-0.13 to -0.62+/-0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to -0.25+/-0.12 (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P<0.001, and r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P<0.001, y=0.023x-1.515), The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06+/-0.36 versus -0.22+/-0.41, P<0.01).

D.",,,Investigation of endothelial function by pulse contour analysis: a protocol for drug administration and timing of pulse contour assessment,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"center dot Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new technique used for non-invasive assessment of endothelial function. center dot Endothelial dysfunction is a component of a number of common conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a variety of inflammatory conditions. center dot A standardized method for assessing endothelial function using pulse contour analysis is required to allow comparison between studies. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS center dot This study recommends the optimal dose of vasoactive agents and timing of measurements for the assessment of endothelial function using pulse contour analysis. AIMS Pulse contour analysis (PCA) obtained by finger photoplethysmography produces a digital volume pulse (DVP) including an inflection point in its down-slope. The reflection index (RI: ratio of the inflection point height over the maximal DVP) is responsive to vasodilatation. We aimed to optimize the drug dose and time interval for assessing endothelial function using PCA in healthy volunteers and patients with severe coronary artery disease. METHODS Time and dose to RI response relationships were constructed in 16 volunteers and nine patients to inhaled salbutamol (100-400 mu g) or sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG; 25-400 mu g). RESULTS For the volunteers, the time to maximum RI response to inhaled salbutamol and sublingual NTG was 10.73 +/- 0.41 and 3.66 +/- 0.21 min, respectively. A plateau in the RI response to salbutamol occurred between 5 and 15 min after inhalation and results were averaged over this period. A dose-dependent response was observed to inhaled salbutamol and sublingual NTG (P = 0.05 and P < 0.001 by repeated-measures anova, respectively) in healthy volunteers. By contrast, in patients with severe coronary artery disease inhaled salbutamol (100-400 mu g) did not cause a significant change in RI. CONCLUSIONS In healthy volunteers the RI response to inhaled salbutamol (100-200 mu g) averaged over 5-15 min after administration may be used to investigate endothelial function by PCA. The response to sublingual NTG (50 mu g) should be determined at 4 min. This technique may not be suitable for the assessment of endothelial function in subjects with extensive coronary artery disease owing to the small responses observed and potential confounding effect of vasoactive medication.",,,,,,"Griffiths, Mark/0000-0002-1615-1896",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-5251,1365-2125,,,,OCT,2009,68,4,,,,,630,633,,10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03482.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03482.x,,,,,,,,19843066,,,,,WOS:000270900300019,View Full Record in Web of Science
