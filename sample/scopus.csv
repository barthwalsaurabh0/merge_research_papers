The long term diabetes increases the risk of the stroke, the heart diseases, the kidney damage and the blindness. Therefore, the blood glucose estimation is crucial for the diabetic patients. The photoplethesmograms (PPGs) can be used for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. In particular, the features were extracted from the PPG represented in both the time domain and the frequency domain. Nevertheless, the total number of the features was very limited. Hence, the performance of the blood glucose estimation was poor. To address this issue, this paper proposes to employ the fractional Fourier transform for extracting the features in the rotated time frequency domain. Since more than one rotational angle can be performed and a set of features can be extracted from each rotational angle, the total number of the features is significantly increased. The computer numerical simulations are conducted. Compared to the method only using the time domain features and the frequency domain features, it is found that the conventional method without the fractional Fourier transform domain features yields 77.2% of all the test data in the Zone A of the grid, respectively. On the other group, our proposed method with the fractional Fourier transform domain features yields 88.6% of all the test data in the Zone A of the grid, respectively. This demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method. © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192553869"

Different medical systems are commercialized to measure blood glucose levels; some are invasive others are noninvasive. The main purpose of this article is to develop a non-invasive device for measuring blood glucose levels based on the detection and analysis of the photoplethysmogram signal. The developed systems include an optical sensor to detect the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, digitalizing and acquiring boards to a computer and a software program to process and analyze the digitalized PPG signal regarding some features extracted from its waveform. These features are the systolic amplitude Sa and the b/a amplitude ratio in the second derivative PPG (SDPPG) waveform. An invasive glucometer is also used along with the Sa and b/a ratio determined from the developed system to generate a calibration model which is used to deduce blood glucose level (BGL) values. The result showed that the calibration model using the b/a ratio is more accurate for non-invasive blood level measurement then that of Sa with a difference in glucose estimation around 2 mg/dl and with the correlation coefficient (R2) of the glucose level prediction between 0.8904 and 0.9775. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Methods: One hundred sixty children and adolescents aged 6–18, 125 patients with type 1 diabetes, and 35 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. We performed a detailed clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, nailfold capillaroscopy, and photoplethysmography. Results: Patients with diabetes had more often abnormal morphology in capillaroscopy (68.60%, p = 0.019), enlarged capillaries (32.6%, p = 0.006), and more often more over five meandering capillaries (20.90%, p = 0.026) compared to healthy controls. Meandering capillaries correlated with higher parameters of nutritional status. In a photoplethysmography, patients with diagnosed neuropathy had a higher percentage of flow disturbance curves (p < 0.001) with a reduced frequency of normal curves (p = 0.050). Conclusions: Capillaroscopic and photoplethysmographic examinations are non-invasive, painless, fast, and inexpensive. They are devoid of side effects, and there are no limitations in the frequency of their use and repetition. The usefulness of capillaroscopy and photoplethysmography in the study of microcirculation in diabetic patients indicates the vast application possibilities of these methods in clinical practice. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174616629"

There are many methods used for blood glucose prediction, such as using NIR and PPG for accurate blood glucose prediction, however, these data are usually not easy to acquire, and using data from wearable devices may be a potential direction. In this paper, two methods were proposed using the latest dataset released by Physiconet in 2023, 1-D CNN and tsfresh, for feature extraction of sensor data, and then construct a GRU network to predict blood glucose values, comparing the effectiveness of the two methods. Besides, the effects of different sensor features on the prediction results are explored. The study shows that the features extracted by tsfresh can follow the trend of blood glucose changes well, but it is still far from predicting specific blood glucose value.

In this paper, we present a robust novel paradigm based on analyzing photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. The method includes signal pre-processing optimization and a multi-view cross-fusion transformer (MvCFT) network for non-invasive BG assessment. Specifically, a multi-size weighted fitting (MSWF) time-domain filtering algorithm is proposed to optimally preserve the most authentic morphological features of the original signals. Meanwhile, the spatial position encoding-based kinetics features are reconstructed and embedded as prior knowledge to discern the implicit physiological patterns. In addition, a cross-view feature fusion (CVFF) module is designed to incorporate pairwise mutual information among different views to adequately capture the potential complementary features in physiological sequences. Finally, the subject-wise 5-fold cross-validation is performed on a clinical dataset of 260 subjects. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of BG measurements are 1.129 mmol/L and 0.659 mmol/L, respectively, and the optimal Zone A in the Clark error grid, representing none clinical risk, is 87.89%.

Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of people over 55 years; many more have asymptomatic PAD. Early detection enables modification of arterial disease risk factors. Diagnostically, assessment of symptoms or signs can be unreliable; ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) testing is time-consuming and few healthcare professionals are properly trained. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG), an alternative non-invasive test for PAD, in primary care. PAD patients identified from general practice registers were age- and sex-matched with controls. Participants were assessed using MPPG, ABPI and duplex ultrasound (DUS). Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of MPPG and ABPI (relative to DUS) and concordance. MPPG test results were available in 249 of 298 eligible participants from 16 practices between May 2015 and November 2016. DUS detected PAD in 101/249 (40.6%). MPPG sensitivity was 79.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.9–87.6%), with specificity 71.9% (95% CI 63.7–79.2%). ABPI sensitivity was 80.2% (95% CI 70.8–87.6%), with specificity 88.6% (95% CI 82–93.5%). With comparable sensitivity to ABPI, MPPG is quick, automated and simpler to do than ABPI; it offers the potential for rapid and accessible PAD assessments in primary care. © The Author(s) 2022.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136471886"

Non-invasive BGL estimation addresses these issues effectively. The proposed study focuses on estimating blood glucose levels (BGL) using “Red-Green-Blue (RGB)” and “Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color spaces” by analyzing fingertip videos captured with a smartphone camera. The goal is to enhance BGL prediction accuracy through accessible, portable devices, using a novel fingertip video database from 234 subjects. Videos recorded in the “RGB color space” using a smartphone camera were converted into the “HSV color space”. The “R channel” from “RGB” and the “Hue channel” from “HSV” were used to generate photoplethysmography (PPG) waves, and additional features like age, gender, and BMI were included to improve predictive accuracy. To enhance the precision of blood glucose estimation, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to identify the most significant and optimal features from the large set of features. The “XGBoost”, “CatBoost”, “Random Forest Regression (RFR)”, and “Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)” algorithms were applied for blood glucose level (BGL) prediction. Among them, “XGBoost” yielded the best results, with an R2 value of 0.89 in the “RGB color space” and 0.84 in the “HSV color space”, showcasing its superior predictive ability. The experimental outcomes were assessed using “Clarke error grid analysis” and a “Bland-Altman plot”.

However, the only way to check blood glucose levels regularly is to use invasive methods, such as pricking the fingertip or using a minimally invasive patch. These invasive methods pose several problems, including being painful and potentially causing secondary infections. This study focuses on noninvasively measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using PPG signals. In particular, the study relates to a method and a hardware design technology for removing noise that may be present in a PPG signal due to skin contact with a noninvasive HbA1c measurement device. The proposed HbA1c measurement device consists of the first sensor (PPG sensor) module including an optical barrier and the second sensor (cylindrical sensor) module for removing the skin effect. We have developed a Monte Carlo method to implement accurate, noninvasive HbA1c measurement by considering different skin properties among different subjects. Implementing this model in wearable devices will allow end users to not only monitor their glycated hemoglobin levels but also control diabetes with higher accuracy without needing any blood samples. This will be a groundbreaking advancement in modern wearable medical devices. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205070748"

Initially, DM occurs while the insulin secretion in the pancreas has a disability to secrete or to use hormone for the metabolic process. Moreover, there are different types of DM depending on the physiological process, and the types include Type1 DM, Type2 DM and Gestational DM. Electrocardiography (ECG) waves are used to detect the abnormal heartbeats and cannot directly detect DM, but the wave abnormality can indicate the possibility and presence of DM. Whereas the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are a non-invasive method used to detect changes in blood volume that can monitor BG changes. Furthermore, the detection and classification of DM using PPG and ECG can involve analyzing the functional performance of these modalities. By extracting the features like R wave (W1) and QRS complex (W2) in the ECG signals and Pulse Width (S1) and Pulse Amplitude Variation (S2) can detect DM and can be classified into DM and NonDM. The authors propose a Novel architecture in the basis of Encoder Decoder structure named as Obstructive Encoder Decoder module. This module extracts the specific features and the proposed novel Obstructive Erasing Module remove the remaining artifacts and then the extracted features are fed into the Multi-Uni-Net for the fusion of the two modalities and the fused image is classified using EXplainable Machine Learning (EX-ML). From this classification the performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and AUC can be determined. © 2024, Polish Association for Knowledge Promotion.

However, traditional invasive methods, such as fingertip blood sampling, cause inconvenience and discomfort to patients, resulting in reduced compliance and motivation for diabetes management. Furthermore, these methods increase the risk of infection due to frequent blood sampling. Therefore, this research aims to develop a non-invasive model for predicting glucose levels based on blood volume pulse (BVP) signals. These devices employ Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technique that monitors changes in blood volume due to periodic heartbeats, to acquire BVP signals. By leveraging machine learning, specifically the long short-term memory network (LSTM), our model thoroughly processes, cleans, segments, and extracts features from these signals. Our approach enables not only real-time monitoring of blood glucose levels but also the prediction of future glucose trends, crucial for timely medication adjustments and disease management. Experimental results reveal that our LSTM model significantly outperforms traditional RNN and linear regression models in predicting blood glucose levels within clinically acceptable ranges. This study offers a more convenient and accurate method for diabetic patients to monitor their blood glucose levels, thereby enhancing their overall health management.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, both cause discomfort to the patients which may inhibit them for regular blood glucose checks. Photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensing technology is an approach for non-invasive blood glucose measurement and PPG sensors can be used to predict hypoglycaemic episodes. InChcek is a PPG-based non-invasive glucose monitor. However, its accuracy has not been checked yet. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of InCheck, a non-invasive glucose monitor for the estimation of blood glucose. Methods: In a tertiary care hospital, patients who came for blood glucose estimation were tested for blood glucose non-invasively on the InCheck device and then by the laboratory method (glucose oxidase-peroxidase). These two readings were compared. We used International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15197:2013 (95% of values should be within ± 15 mg/dL of reference reading if reference glucose <100 mg/dL or within ± 15% of reference reading if reference glucose ≥100 mg/dL and 99% of the values should be within zones A and B in consensus error grid), and Surveillance Error Grid for analyzing the accuracy. Results: A total of 1223 samples were analyzed. There was a significant difference between the reference method glucose level (135 [Q1-Q3: 97-179] mg/dL) and monitor-measured glucose level (188.33 [Q1-Q3: 167.33-209.33] mg/dL) (P < 0.0001). A total of 18.5% of readings were following ISO 15197:2013 criteria and 67.25% of coordinates were within zone A and zone B of the consensus error grid. In the surveillance error grid analysis, about 29.4% of values were in the no-risk zone, 51.8% in slight risk, 18.6% in moderate risk, and 0.2% were in the severe risk zone. Conclusion: The accuracy of the InCheck device for the estimation of blood glucose by PPG signal is not following the recommended guidelines. Hence, further research is necessary for programming or redesigning the hardware and software for a better result from this optical sensor-based non-invasive home glucose monitor. © 2024 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186473147"

The study group included 203 convalescents aged 60.0 (55.0–63.0) and 115 (56.7%) women. The ASCVD risk was assessed as low to moderate to very high based on medical history (for 62 participants with pre-existing ASCVD/diabetes/chronic kidney disease in the entire cohort) or calculated in percentages using the Systemic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) algorithm based on age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure (BP), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for 141 healthy participants). The stiffness index (SI) and reflection index (RI) measured by photoplethysmography, as well as pulse pressure (PP), calculated as the difference between systolic and diastolic BP, were markers of arterial stiffness. Stiffness parameters increased significantly with the increase in ASCVD risk in the entire cohort. In 30 (14.8%) patients in the low- to moderate-risk group, the median SI was 8.07 m/s (7.10–8.73), RI 51.40% (39.40–65.60), and PP 45.50 mmHg (40.00–57.00); in 111 (54.7%) patients in the high-risk group, the median SI was 8.70 m/s (7.40–10.03), RI 57.20% (43.65–68.40), and PP 54.00 mmHg (46.00–60.75); and in 62 (30.5%) patients in the very-high-risk group, the median was SI 9.27 m/s (7.57–10.44), RI 59.00% (50.40–72.40), and PP 60.00 mmHg (51.00–67.00). In healthy participants, the SI ≤ 9.0 m/s (sensitivity of 92.31%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.686, p < 0.001) based on the receiver operating characteristics was the most sensitive variable for discriminating low to moderate risk, and PP > 56.0 mmHg (sensitivity of 74.36%, AUC 0.736, p < 0.001) was used for discriminating very high risk. In multivariate logistic regression, younger age, female sex, PP ≤ 50 mmHg, SI ≤ 9.0 m/s, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dL had the best relationship with low to moderate SCORE2 risk. In turn, older age, currently smoking, PP > 56.0 mmHg, RI > 68.6%, and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg were related to very high SCORE2 risk. In conclusion, arterial stiffness is significantly related to ASCVD risk in post-COVID-19 patients and can be helpful as a single risk marker in everyday practice. Cut-off points for arterial stiffness parameters determined based on SCORE2 may help make individual decisions about implementing lifestyle changes or pharmacological treatment of ASCVD risk factors © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205130611"

At present, there is no effective cure for diabetes, only frequent monitoring to control blood glucose levels. Previous detection methods mainly rely on fingertip puncture to obtain blood samples, which is not only painful but also highly susceptible to infection for patients. Therefore, the use of non-invasive methods to monitor blood glucose has broad prospects and important significance. Nevertheless, the features used for estimating the blood glucose values cannot be extracted accurately from the denoised photoplethesmograms (PPG) when the sampling rate of the PPGs is too low. To address this issue, this paper proposes the fractional singular spectrum analysis (SSA) based super-resolution method to generate the PPGs with the high equivalent sampling rate from those with the low sampling rate. Since the fractional SSA operation is nonlinear and adaptive, this super-resolution method is nonlinear and adaptive. To obtain the estimated blood glucose values, both the conventional detrending algorithm and the SSA bit plane denoising method are applied to the PPGs. Second, both the heart rate variability features of the processed PPGs are extracted. Finally, the blood glucose values are estimated via the random forest regression model. Compare to the results obtained based on the PPGs without performing the super-resolution, it is found that more features can be extracted after performing the super-resolution. As a result, the estimation performances based on the super-resoluted PPGs are better.  © 2023 ACM.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191413625"

The objective of this study is to provide an alternative method that allows a non-invasive estimation of blood glucose levels with an elevated level of confidence. In this work, 187 records were performed on people without any declared pathology; the concentration of blood glucose and the amplitude of the PPG signals of 525 nm, 660 and 940 nm were measured simultaneously. 70% of the data was used to train a regression model based on a fine Gaussian support vector machine, while the remaining 30% is used to validate the results.

Considering the mutual endothelial insult leading to similar undesirable peripheral hemodynamic perturbations, hypertension (HT) may blunt this classification performance. Second derivative PPG (SD-PPG) indices were derived from the second derivative of the PPG signal. The variables of interest were the previously described peaks of the initial positive (a), early negative (b), re-increasing (c), late re-decreasing (d), diastolic positive (e) and negative (f) waves and the ratios between them. Patients were classified according to their type 2 DM and hypertension phenotypes. SD-PPG indices were compared between diseased subgroups, healthy controls and also dichotomous classification performance was evaluated. Two SDPPG indices, b/a ratio and the vascular ageing index (VAI = (b-c-d-e)/a) responded to isolated DM type 2 (n = 29) amongst healthy subjects (n = 106) (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.629 p = 0.034 and 0.631 p = 0.031 20 respectively). However, the classification performance became insignificant with the inclusion of HT patients (n=30). (p = 0.839 vs. p = 0.656).

Utilizing wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) with machine learning to estimate HbA1c can be a promising method for non-invasive HbA1c monitoring in diabetic patients. This study aims to develop a HbA1c estimation system based on machine learning algorithms using PPG signals obtained from the wrist. We used a PPG based dataset of 22 subjects and algorithms such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boost (CatBoost) and random forest (RF) to estimate the HbA1c values. Note that the AC-to-DC ratios for three wavelengths were newly adopted as features in addition to the previously acquired 15 features from the PPG signal and a comparative analysis was performed between the performances of several algorithms. We showed that feature-importance-based selection can improve performance while reducing computational complexity. We also showed that AC-to-DC ratio (AC/DC) features play a dominant role in improving HbA1c estimation performance and, furthermore, a good performance can be obtained without the need for external features such as BMI and SpO2. These findings may help shape the future of wrist-based HbA1c estimation (e.g., via a wristwatch or wristband), which could increase the scope of noninvasive and effective monitoring techniques for diabetic patients. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168732017"

This invasive method is not capable of continuously monitoring a diabetic patient's blood glucose levels and can be painful and inconvenient in the long term. In our study, we developed a noninvasive blood glucose estimation method using dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with pulse arrival velocity (PAV). The dual-channel PPG was chosen based on the advantages of 530 nm PPG in blood flow measurement and 1550 nm infrared light in blood glucose concentration detection. In addition to testing various amplitude features in PPG at different fiducial points (systolic peak, dicrotic notch, and diastolic peak), we also examined the amplitude ratio between the two PPG channels (530 nm green-light PPG and 1550 nm infrared PPG), as well as PAV, for noninvasive blood glucose estimation. In this study, we recruited 18 healthy subjects (14 males and four females; aged 29.4 ± 7.87 years old). The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) experiment was conducted on each participant to manipulate the blood glucose level. Each parameter for blood glucose estimation was examined using partial F-test to assess its impact on blood glucose estimation.

Method: A customized module combining a reflective PPG sensor with a peak emission wavelength of 940 nm and an ultrasonic sensor with an operating frequency of 40 kHz was developed. 4-min PPG recordings (two minutes with ultrasound; two minutes without ultrasound) were acquired from 53 volunteers, including 19 diabetic patients, after conventional blood sample collection via an invasive glucometer. We computed Pearson's coefficient (r), the mean absolute error (MAE), Bland-Altman plots, and Clarke error grids to explore the relationship between PI and glucose values and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, with and without ultrasound. Results: When ultrasonic waves were applied, PI showed a higher correlation with blood glucose levels (r = −0.90, p < 0.001), MAE significantly decreased (p = 0.0051), the bias was slightly closer to zero, the LOA interval became narrower, and predicted glucose levels deviating from reference values by more than 20 % decreased in number.

This paper selected four detection bands, 625nm, 740nm, 850nm, and 940nm, to characterize the concentration information of glucose, melanin, fat, and other substances in the human body at different wavelengths. This paper used a microcontroller to synchronize the imaging CCD device with the light source, sequentially capture images under four wavelength light sources, and obtain IPPG signals of multiple wavelengths through image processing techniques, eliminating signal artifacts and baseline drift of IPPG signals. After processing the IPPG signal, 48 time-domain features including KTE and logE characteristics were obtained. This paper used calculated signal features as temporal features, images as spatial features, and a combination of IPPG signals generated at four wavelengths as spectral domain features. A robust blood glucose prediction model was established using denoising autoencoder neural networks and Late Fusion multimodal fusion techniques. Clarke Error Grid Analysis (EGA) showed that 91.43% of predicted blood glucose values were within the range of A, indicating that the predicted blood glucose values obtained through our method are acceptable in clinical practice, providing technical support for the development of video based optical imaging non-invasive blood glucose detection technology. © 2025 SPIE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219480318"

A suspected person may have symptoms such as abrupt weight loss, increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, etc. The conventional method requires invasive blood testing methods performed in specific laboratories. The work proposes a non-invasive solution to measure %HbA1c using Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. A PPG sensor records these signals at two distinct wavelengths, i.e., green and infrared (IR). After initial preprocessing and feature extraction, a random forest regressor estimates the %HbA1c. The study is validated with recording of 9 subjects. The estimation of the results shows a high degree of correlation with 0.907 and 0.952 pearson's correlation coefficient r values for the reflective PPG signal. These calculated values are compared with the true %HbA1c values. The results show a close approximation of the calculated values to the true values.

Next, the quaternion valued long short term memory (QLSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed for estimating the non-invasive blood glucose values. Unlike the traditional methods based on extracting the features in each channel of the PPGs independently and fusing all the features together in the conventional neural networks, the quaternion valued operations performed on the quaternion valued PPGs only fuse the same features among these four channels together while do not fuse different features among these four channels together.

Few studies discuss prediction accuracy in the case of a large time interval span between modeling and prediction. This paper proposes an automatic optimal threshold baseline removal algorithm based on variational mode decomposition (AOT-VMD), which can adaptively eliminate high-frequency noise and baseline interference for each decomposed IMF modal component and reduce the baseline difference of PPG signals from different days. Furthermore, a fuzzy integral multi-model decision fusion algorithm based on error weight is proposed. The fuzzy integral operator is introduced to make the features with large contributions in each sub-model maintain a high-weight value in the overall prediction mechanism, which improves the prediction accuracy of blood glucose. In this paper, a self-developed portable PPG glucose meter is used to collect PPG signals, and the true blood glucose values for 8 consecutive days are collected by CGM. The proposed algorithm is used to build a model with the first day's data and predict the blood glucose values for the remaining 7 days. The experimental results show that the AOT-VMD preprocessing algorithm and the quantitative regression algorithm of the fuzzy integral multiple model decision fusion algorithm proposed in this paper perform well in measurement accuracy and time adaptability compared with the traditional methods. In addition, the proposed method requires less invasive calibration samples in the modeling stage, achieving high-precision prediction for a long period. 100% of the samples are located in areas A and B of the Clarke area in this experiment, and the algorithm has strong time generalization ability. This innovative method can promote the development of a home blood glucose noninvasive detector. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209741974"

Non-invasive methods have emerged for timely detection; however, their limited accuracy constrains clinical usage. In this research, we present a novel Higher Dimensional Transformer (HDformer), the first Transformer-based architecture which utilizes long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect diabetes. The long-range PPG maximizes signal contextual information when compared to the less-than 30 second signals commonly used in existing research. To increase the computational efficiency of HDformer’s long-range processing, a new attention module, Time Square Attention (TSA), is invented to achieve linear computational complexity with respect to the token volume while retaining the local/global dependencies. TSA converts the 1D inputs into 2D representations, grouping the adjacent points into a single 2D token. It then generates dynamic patches and feeds them into a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) network, optimizing the learning on different attention areas. HDformer achieves state-of-the-art results (sensitivity 98.4, accuracy 97.3, specificity 92.8, AUC 0.929) on the standard MIMIC-III dataset, surpassing existing research. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end solution where a low-cost wearable is prototyped to connect with the HDformer in the Cloud via a mobile app. This scalable, convenient, and affordable approach provides instantaneous detection and continuous monitoring for individuals. It aids doctors in easily screening for diabetes and safeguards underprivileged communities. The enhanced versatility of HDformer allows for efficient processing and learning of long-range signals in general one-dimensional time-series sequences, particularly for all biomedical waveforms.

Using the support vector machine technique, the classification is done at the software level, while Xilinx Zynq 7000 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip is utilized for hardware design. The overall accuracy for detecting cerebral infarction and cerebrovascular disease is 93.48% and 96.43%, respectively, using eleven features. In addition, diabetes which is linked to cardiovascular diseases is classified, and an accuracy of 88.46% is achieved. Considering the PPG signal with a higher signal quality index, the overall accuracy for all the diseases can be further increased. The resource and power utilization of the implemented system is analyzed, which shows that 0.693 W power is required.

Specifically, a Deep Sparse Capsule Network (DSCNet) model is proposed to provide accurate and robust BGL monitoring. The proposed model’s workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictions. A hardware module was designed using a PPG sensor and Raspberry Pi to collect patient data. In preprocessing, a Savitzky–Golay filter and moving average filter were applied to remove noise and preserve pulse form and high-frequency components. The DSCNet model was then applied to predict the sugar level. Two models were developed for prediction: a baseline model, DSCNet, and an enhanced model, DSCNet with self-attention. DSCNet’s performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD), and coefficient of determination (R2), yielding values of 3.022, 0.05, 0.058, 0.062, 10.81, and 0.98, respectively. © 2025 by the authors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001134920"

The CAD diagnostic pathway would greatly benefit from a test to assess for CAD that enables the physician to rule it out at the point of care, thereby enabling the exploration of other diagnoses more rapidly. We sought to develop a test using machine learning to assess for CAD with a rule-out profile, using an easy-to-acquire signal (without stress/radiation) at the point of care. Given the historic disparate outcomes between sexes and urban/rural geographies in cardiology, we targeted equal performance across sexes in a geographically accessible test. Noninvasive photoplethysmogram and orthogonal voltage gradient signals were simultaneously acquired in a representative clinical population of subjects before invasive catheterization for those with CAD (gold-standard for the confirmation of CAD) and coronary computed tomographic angiography for those without CAD (excellent negative predictive value). Features were measured from the signal and used in machine learning to predict CAD status. The machine-learned algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 59%. The rule-out profile was maintained across both sexes, as well as all other relevant subgroups. A test to assess for CAD using machine learning on a noninvasive signal has been successfully developed, showing high performance and rule-out ability. Confirmation of the performance on a large clinical, blinded, enrollment-gated dataset is required before implementation of the test in clinical practice. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190142382"

This study explores the potential of PPG signal features for enhancing the accuracy of diabetes classification using machine learning models.

PAD is common; it is estimated to affect 236 million individuals worldwide. Advanced age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and concomitant cardiovascular disease are common factors associated with increased risk of PAD. Complications of PAD can include claudication pain, rest pain, wounds, gangrene, amputation and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is therefore clinically important to use diagnostic tests that accurately identify PAD. Accurate and timely detection of PAD allows clinicians to implement appropriate risk management strategies to prevent complications, slow progression or intervene when indicated. Toe-brachial index (TBI) and toe systolic blood pressure (TSBP) are amongst a suite of non-invasive bedside tests used to detect PAD. Both TBI and TSBP are commonly utilised by a variety of clinicians in different settings, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy is warranted and highly relevant to inform clinical practice. Objectives: To (1) estimate the accuracy of TSBP and TBI for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities at different cut-off values for test positivity in populations at risk of PAD, and (2) compare the accuracy of TBI and TSBP for the diagnosis of PAD in the lower extremities. Secondary objectives were to investigate several possible sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy, including the following: patient group tested (people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, people with renal disease and general population), type of equipment used, positivity threshold and type of reference standard. Search methods: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, Zetoc and DARE databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 27 February 2024. Selection criteria: We included diagnostic case-control, cross-sectional, prospective and retrospective studies in which all participants had either a TSBP or TBI measurement plus a validated method of vascular diagnostic imaging for PAD. We needed to be able to cross-tabulate (2 x 2 table) results of the index test and the reference standard to include a study. To be included, study populations had to be adults aged 18 years and over. We included studies of symptomatic and asymptomatic participants. Studies had to use TSBP and TBI (also called toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI)), either individually, or in addition to other non-invasive tests as index tests to diagnose PAD in individuals with suspected disease. We included data collected by photoplethysmography, laser Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and manual or automated digital equipment. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently completed data extraction using a standardised form. We extracted data to populate 2 x 2 contingency tables when available (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives). Where data were not available to enable statistical analysis, we contacted study authors directly. Two review authors working independently undertook quality assessment using QUADAS-2, with disagreements resolved by a third review author. We incorporated two additional questions into the quality appraisal to aid our understanding of the conduct of studies and make appropriate judgements about risk of bias and applicability. Main results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria; 13 evaluated TBI only, one evaluated TSBP only and four evaluated both TBI and TSBP. Thirteen of the studies used colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) as a reference standard, two used computed tomography angiography (CTA), one used multi-detector row tomography (MDCT), one used angiography and one used a combination of CDU, CTA and angiography. TBI was investigated in 1927 participants and 2550 limbs. TSBP was investigated in 701 participants, of which 701 limbs had TSBP measured. Studies were generally of low methodological quality, with poor reporting of participant recruitment in regard to consecutive or random sampling, and poor reporting of blinding between index test and reference standard, as well as timing between index test and reference standard. The certainty of evidence according to GRADE for most studies was very low. Authors' conclusions: Whilst a small number of diagnostic test accuracy studies have been completed for TBI and TSBP to identify PAD, the overall methodological quality was low, with most studies providing a very low certainty of evidence. The evidence base to support the use of TBI and TSBP to identify PAD is therefore limited. Whilst both TBI and TSBP are used extensively clinically, the overall diagnostic performance of these tests remains uncertain. Future research using robust methods and clear reporting is warranted to comprehensively determine the diagnostic test accuracy of the TBI and TSBP for identification of PAD with greater certainty. However, conducting such research where some of the reference tests are invasive and only clinically indicated in populations with known PAD is challenging. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

However, traditional glucose monitoring methods suffer from invasiveness, discomfort, and potential infection. This paper introduces an innovative approach that utilizes non-invasive data sources derived from wearable devices, namely Photoplethysmography (PPG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), in combination with user-provided food logs. The proposed model, MMG-Net, uses the three waveforms along with food features extracted from food logs to estimate blood glucose levels. MMG-Net delivers exceptional performance metrics, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 13.51 mg/dL, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 12.57 %, and a Root Mean Square Error of 17.26 mg/dL. Notably, MMG-Net outperforms existing solutions in the estimation of blood glucose levels, solidifying its status as an innovative approach. The model's clinical precision is substantiated through Clarke Error Grid analysis, with a remarkable 99.43 % of predictions falling within clinically acceptable ranges. This paper presents a substantial advancement in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, offering a promising avenue for enhanced disease management among hyperglycemic patients with only wearable devices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185250669"

To enhance the convenience of BG monitoring, we employed infrared pulsed sensing (IPS) to capture photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG signals effectively reflect changes in blood volume within the human body, providing rich information about BG. In this article, we designed a BG detection system based on an IPS and a deep hybrid feature neural network. By deploying IPS and deep learning algorithms on a Raspberry Pi, the system is equipped with data collection, analysis, prediction, and display capabilities for real-time BG monitoring. Previous studies relying on shallow machine learning for BG detection struggled to capture the complex underlying correlations between PPG signals and BG. Our proposed deep hybrid feature neural network model, DCC-Net, achieves end-to-end BG prediction by capturing different temporal and spatial features in PPG signals. The F2M fusion module combines multiscale and multilevel features, effectively modeling the intricate nonlinear relationship between PPG signals and BG, thereby improving classification performance. We recruited 290 participants and used IPS to collect PPG signals, constructing an IPS-PPG dataset. Testing DCC-Net on the IPS-PPG dataset yielded an impressive overall classification accuracy of 0.92, demonstrating its high accuracy. Furthermore, our model showed good generalization performance on the publicly available dataset PPG-BP. The proposed approach exhibits significant potential for advancing research and development in noninvasive BG detection systems.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188001198"

Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify relevant features of vulnerable plaque in functionally significant lesions. Methods: In this multicenter, prospective study conducted across 5 countries, including patients who had invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80, a total of 95 patients with available pullback pressure gradient (PPG) and plaque analysis on coronary computed tomographic angiography and optical coherence tomography were analyzed. Vulnerable plaque was defined as the presence of plaque rupture or thin-cap fibroatheroma on optical coherence tomography. Among the 25 clinical characteristics, invasive angiographic findings, physiological indexes, and coronary computed tomographic angiographic findings, significant predictors of vulnerable plaque were identified. Results: Mean percentage diameter stenosis, FFR, and PPG were 77.8% ± 14.6%, 0.66 ± 0.13, and 0.65 ± 0.13, respectively. Vulnerable plaque was present in 53 lesions (55.8%). PPG and FFR were identified as significant predictors of vulnerable plaque (P < 0.05 for all). PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70 were significantly related to a higher probability of vulnerable plaque after adjustment for each other (OR: 6.75 [95% CI: 2.39-19.1]; P < 0.001] for PPG >0.65; OR: 4.61 [95% CI: 1.66-12.8]; P = 0.003 for FFR ≤0.70). When categorizing lesions according to combined PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70, the prevalence of vulnerable plaque was 20.0%, 57.1%, 66.7%, and 88.2% in the order of PPG ≤0.65 and FFR >0.70, PPG ≤0.65 and FFR ≤0.70, PPG >0.65 and FFR >0.70, and PPG >0.65 and FFR ≤0.70 (P for trend < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: Among low-FFR lesions, the presence of vulnerable plaque can be predicted by PPG combined with FFR without additional anatomical or plaque characteristics.

Traditional invasive methods for such monitoring can be cumbersome and uncomfortable for patients. In this study, we introduce a noninvasive approach to estimate blood glucose levels using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. We have focused on blood glucose prediction using wrist PPG signals and explored various PPG waveform-based features, including AC to DC ratio (AC/DC) and intrinsic mode function (IMF)-based features derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been found using EMD-based features to estimate blood glucose levels noninvasively. Additionally, feature importance-based selection has also been used to further improve the accuracy of the proposed model. Among the four machine learning algorithms considered in this study, CatBoost consistently outperformed XGBoost, LightGBM, and random forest across a wide number of features. The best performing model, CatBoost, achieved Pearson’s r of 0.96, MSE 0.08, (Formula presented.) score 0.92, and MAE 8.01 when considering the top 50 features selected from both PPG waveform-based features and IMF-based features.

Since HbA1c reflects the average blood glucose level over the preceding three months, it is unaffected by a patient’s activity level or diet before a test. Noninvasive HbA1c measurement reduces both the pain and complications associated with fingertip piercing to collect blood. Photoplethysmography is helpful for measuring HbA1c without blood samples. Herein, only two wavelengths (615 and 525 nm) were used to estimate HbA1c noninvasively, where two different ratio calibrations were applied and their performances were compared to a work that used three wavelengths. For the fingertip type, the Pearson’s r values for HbA1c estimates were 0.896 and 0.905, considering the ratio calibrations for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. Using another value (HbA1c) calibration in addition to the ratio calibrations, we could improve this performance such that the Pearson’s r values of the HbA1c levels were 0.929 and 0.930 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively. In a previous study, using three wavelengths, the Pearson’s r values were 0.916 and 0.959 for the blood vessel and whole finger models, respectively.

Regular blood glucose (BG) monitoring is key for avoiding diabetic complications. Traditional BG measurement techniques are invasive and minimally invasive, causing pain, discomfort, cost, and infection risks. To address these issues, we developed a noninvasive BG monitoring approach on photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using multi-view attention and cascaded BiLSTM hierarchical feature fusion approach. Firstly, we implemented a convolutional multi-view attention block to extract the temporal features through adaptive contextual information aggregation. Secondly, we built a cascaded BiLSTM network to efficiently extract the fine-grained features through bidirectional learning. Finally, we developed a hierarchical feature fusion with bilinear polling through cross-layer interaction to obtain higher-order features for BG monitoring. For validation, we conducted comprehensive experimentation on up to 6 days of PPG and BG data from 21 participants. The proposed approach showed competitive results compared to existing approaches by RMSE of 1.67 mmol/L and MARD of 17.88%. Additionally, the clinical accuracy using Clarke error grid (CEG) analysis showed 98.80% of BG values in Zone A+B. Therefore, the proposed approach offers a favorable solution in diabetes management by noninvasively monitoring the BG levels. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204985657"

The paper aims to examine the variation in arterial stiffness at two different points, point A (3 cm above the foot on the posterior tibial artery (PTA)) and point B (on the foot) to facilitate early detection and monitoring of PAD in people with diabetes. A novel non-invasive photoplethysmography (PPG) device was developed to acquire signals from the PTA using optical sensors, a microcontroller, and an analog-to-digital converter. Signals were collected from three categories: 'Healthy and Young (< 40 years, N=20)', 'Age matched controls (AMC) (> 40 years, N=20)', and 'Diabetic and Aged (> 40 years, N=20)'. The study found consistent pulse wave patterns in healthy subjects but distinct variations in those with diabetes and PAD. In subjects with diabetes, the stiffness index increased from point A to point B. By evaluating pulse signals at multiple points, the study captured arterial property variations at point B caused by PAD, which might not have been evident in single-point analyses. This approach improves the thoroughness of the detection and emphasizes the significance of acquiring signals from multiple points to evaluate arterial health accurately. © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215269252"

This study evaluated the safety of bilateral brachial pressure measurement in patients with clinical suspicion of dialysis-associated steal syndrome (DASS). Methods: Patients undergoing non-invasive testing for steal syndrome between September 2015 and December 2021 were included in this study. The diagnostic workup was performed by certified vascular sonographers in an outpatient vascular lab and consisted of bilateral brachial pressures, photoplethysmography, and duplex ultrasonography of the access. Interarm differential (IAD) was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the contralateral arm minus SBP in the access arm. The primary endpoint was immediate access thrombosis. Results: The study sample consisted of 331 subjects with a mean age of 61 ± 13 and a median access age of 9 months (3–31 months) with radiocephalic fistulas present in 29%. Many patients (68%) presented with paresthesia and 4% presented with tissue loss. The mean brachial systolic pressure was 152 ± 37 mmHg on the ipsilateral arm versus 143 ± 34 mmHg on the contralateral (p-value <0.001), with an inter-arm differential (IAD) of −8.4 ± 19 mmHg. A total of 16 subjects (5%) presented a differential ⩾20 mmHg. A positive thrill was noted in all the accesses immediately following blood pressure measurement and no occurrence of access thrombosis was noted at 30 days. Proximal arterial revascularization interventions were performed in 11 cases (3%). Subjects who presented an IAD ⩾20 mmHg had lower ipsilateral digital-brachial index (0.39 ± 0.18 vs 0.68 ± 0.26; p = 0.037), a higher tendency of being referred for angiograms (37.5% vs 10.5%, p = 0.006), and more proximal arterial revascularization procedures (25.0% vs 2.2%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Bilateral arm pressure measurement in the context of dialysis access-associated steal syndrome (DASS) appears safe and useful for identifying subjects whose symptoms are due to proximal arterial inflow disease. We therefore recommend this test be considered in the diagnostic algorithms of DASS. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177695776"

To do this, we analyze a largescale dataset from VitalDB, which includes information from 6,388 subjects. By including diverse patient profiles in our dataset, we ensure that our models can be applied to a wide range of individuals. To capture the complex patterns and relationships in PPG signals, we employ a complicated deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our models have achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 23.99, demonstrating their accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, we evaluate the clinical accuracy of the predictions using the Clarke Error Grid analysis, which reveals a high agreement within clinically acceptable ranges. By utilizing the comprehensive VitalDB dataset, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of PPG-based blood glucose prediction and validates the effectiveness of our models on a large-scale cohort. Additionally, we perform a comparison with recent papers, demonstrating why our model excels in various aspects such as model generality with a large dataset, high clinical accuracy, and the requirement of only 10 seconds of PPG data for effective prediction.

Factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes significantly affect cardiovascular health by damaging blood vessels and increasing heart strain. It measured HbAIc, FBG, Lipid profile, and calculation BMI. Using the Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) method, which requires complex equipment and expertise, PPG offers a simpler alternative. By analyzing Pulse Transit Time (PTT) and Digital Pulse Wave (DPW) amplitude after induced blood flow increase (reactive hyperemia), PPG serves as a non-invasive measure for evaluating vascular health, indicating early signs of cardiovascular problems. Methods: 30 Healthy Adhering to ethical standards, the cross-sectional study involved males, ensuring a baseline of metabolic health through measurement of HbA1c, FBG, lipid profile, and calculation of BMI. The measurements were within a normal range. The methodology entailed a standardized protocol for inducing and measuring RH, with signal analysis performed via Lab Chart Pro 7® software. Results: Significant findings include increases in PTT and DPW amplitude during RH, indicating PPG's efficacy in detecting endothelial function changes comparable to FMD. These results validate PPG's potential for broader clinical and research applications, given its simplicity and non-invasiveness. In conclusion, PPG emerges as a promising tool for non-invasively assessing endothelial function, offering insights into vascular health and the progression of cardiovascular diseases.

At present, computer algorithms have been widely used in the classification and prediction of diabetes, and have shown great application value in clinical aspects, the aim of this study was to use a noninvasive approach to simultaneously extract the main weight amplitude ratio sequence of the pulse signal (PPG) and the RRI sequence of ECG, and the coincidence rate between them was calculated by percussion entropy algorithm for the classification of diabetes. In this experiment, the synchronous principal weight amplitude ratio sequences and RRI sequences of healthy subjects (Group 1: 30 people) and diabetic subjects (Group 2: 28 people) were extracted, and the anastomoses between them were calculated using PEn. The normal physiological parameters of the human body and PEn were tested using an independent-sample T-test and Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, the multi-scale cross-approximate entropy (MCAE) was compared with PEn. The results show that $\operatorname{PEn}(\mathbf{p}\lt 0.001)$ distinguished diabetic patients from healthy individuals in a way that was both considerably distinct and superior to MCAE ($\lt 0.05$), and PEn was negatively correlated with both glycosylated hemoglobin ($r=-0.451, p\lt 0.001$) and fasting blood glucose ($r=-0.359, p\lt 0.001$). Not only do the results of this study indicate that the percussion entropy of subject weight ratio sequence and RRI sequence is superior in predicting the vascular health status of diabetes, but they also indicate that the principal weight amplitude ratio sequence and RRI sequence can be used as characterization parameters for diabetes, demonstrating certain research significance for the early screening of diabetes. © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207085056"

The present technique for minimal invasive BGL monitoring involves taking a small blood sample and transferring it to a glucometer. However, this procedure can be uncomfortable for the patient. This research presents a method for non-invasively monitoring BGL with the help of a powerful controller called the ARM Cortex-M4. For non-invasive applications, we use photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Using a photodiode and an infrared LED light, PPG samples are received from a finger sensor. Signal processing and feature extraction are carried out using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. To predict the BGL, two ML models are developed: one employing a Linear Regression (LR) model and the other an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The experimental findings show that the ANN model is quite effective, with an R2 score of 0.986. After careful consideration, the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller's processing capabilities were found to be optimal for running the ANN model. The model must be fine-tuned before deployment so it can communicate with the microcontroller and provide correct inference in real time. The finger sensor simplifies PPG sample collection, and the OLED display makes it simple to view BGL. © 2024 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202344127"

The primary challenge in diabetes management is maintaining blood glucose levels (BGLs) within a safe range to prevent complications such as renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathy. Traditional methods, such as finger-prick testing, often result in low patient adherence due to discomfort, invasiveness, and inconvenience. Consequently, there is an increasing need for non-invasive techniques that provide accurate BGL measurements. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a photosensitive method that detects blood volume variations, has shown promise for non-invasive glucose monitoring. Deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to PPG signals can predict BGLs with high accuracy. However, training DNN models requires large and diverse datasets, which are typically distributed across multiple healthcare institutions. Privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions further limit data sharing, making conventional centralized machine learning (ML) approaches less effective. To address these challenges, this study proposes a federated learning (FL)-based solution that enables multiple healthcare organizations to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw patient data, thereby enhancing model performance while ensuring data privacy and security. In the data preprocessing stage, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to smooth PPG signals and remove baseline drift. Adaptive cycle-based segmentation (ACBS) is then used for signal segmentation, followed by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for feature selection, optimizing classification accuracy. The proposed system was evaluated on diverse datasets, including VitalDB and MUST, under various conditions with data collected during surgery and anesthesia. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.1 mg/dL, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Clarke error grid analysis (CEGA) confirmed the model’s clinical reliability, with 99.31% of predictions falling within clinically acceptable limits. The FL-based approach outperformed conventional deep learning models, making it a promising method for non-invasive, privacy-preserving glucose monitoring. © 2025 by the authors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003401272"

In this work, we report a comprehensive set of protocols to estimate BGL from the raw PPG time-series. The protocol is trained on 1153 distinct entries. Pre-processing was done using Kalman smoothing for noise reduction, wavelet-based baseline correction, and the AMPD algorithm for automatic trough detection. The protocol includes extensive feature extraction of 392 features including single pulse area-based features of which 26 features were determined as statistically significant. Of the various machine learning (ML) models trained on these features, the Voting regressor performed best, yielding an R2 value of 0.921. We further trained a human interpretable (novel white-box) model using PySR which also yielded a remarkably high R2 value of 0.815. Importantly, the study demonstrates successful feature reduction, showing that even with a smaller set of features, predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and clinical relevance (as demonstrated by Clarke Error Grids, 90% and 70% in zone A for black and white-box models respectively) remain largely unaffected. The white-box model in non-invasive BGL estimation significantly enhances interpretability, making it highly suitable for clinical applications where transparency and reliability are crucial. © 2025","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216869490"

If untreated in the initial stage, diabetes-related problems such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiac complications arise in the body. It must be detected early in order to receive proper treatment, which can prevent the condition from progressing to severe complications. This study proposed a non-invasive type 2 diabetes classification system using short PPG signals through various machine learning (ML) techniques. Method: Our dataset includes 80 healthy and 80 type2 diabetic patients. From each subject, we extracted total 118 features from four different domains (time, frequency, demographic-Time domain, and demographic domain). We applied various ML techniques on 68 statistically significant features with or without feature selection technique (FST). Results: Without using the FST, we obtain the highest accuracy of 99.88% and 99.89% using Fine K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Subspace Ensemble of K-nearest neighbor (SE-KNN) techniques respectively.

Therefore, it has a high infection risk and the users are suffered from the pain. Moreover, the long term consumable cost is high. Recently, the wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation approach has been proposed. However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the presence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the obtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable. Moreover, different subjects have different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose. To address this issue, a polynomial fitting approach to smooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values has been proposed. In particular, the design of the coefficients in the polynomial is formulated as the various optimisation problems. First, the blood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimisation approaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood glucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimisation approach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each optimisation approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each sorted blood glucose value, the optimisation method corresponding to the minimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate probability of each selected optimisation method is computed. If the accumulate probability of any selected optimisation method at a point is greater than a threshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected optimisation methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted blood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries points being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after performing the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose values in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose values and the corresponding optimisation methods in these regions are determined. It is worth noting that the conventional lowpass denoising method was performed in the signal domain (either in the time domain or in the frequency domain), while the authors’ proposed method is performed in the feature space or the reference blood glucose space. Hence, the authors’ proposed method can further improve the reliability of the obtained feature values or the reference blood glucose values so as to improve the accuracy of the blood glucose estimation. Moreover, the individual modelling regression method has been employed here to suppress the effects of different users having different responses of the infrared light to the blood glucose values. The computer numerical simulation results show that the authors’ proposed method yields the mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) at 0.0930 and the percentage of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid at 94.1176%. © 2023 The Authors.

Current glucose monitoring methods are invasive, painful, and require skilled application, highlighting the need for the development of effective, non-invasive, and easy to use methods. This paper presents our work on the design, development, and evaluation of a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system, utilizing Near-Infrared Spectroscopy technique for glucose monitoring. The proposed system comprises a MAX30102 biosensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. The biosensor captures the photoplethysmogram signals, which are then processed by a microcontroller to evaluate blood glucose level. In order to increase the accuracy of the results, we have incorporated linear regression with Clarke Error Grid Analysis to calibrate our system. The linear regression model is trained by comparing the results obtained through the developed system with that of a commercial off-the-self invasive device. The glucose levels obtained through the developed system are displayed in real-time on an Organic LED (OLED) screen and simultaneously uploaded to a cloud server via Internet of Things for remote monitoring. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we have compared the performance metrics of our system against existing solutions published in the literature. Performance comparisons show that our system achieves a reasonably good accuracy with a root mean square error of 13.8 mg/dL and a mean absolute relative difference of 12%. The proposed system offers a painless and convenient solution, potentially improving glucose monitoring for patients. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000146641"

We present the design, development, and validation of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) based wearable device for non-invasive and real-time measurement of blood glucose. This paper presents a diabetic health monitoring platform architecture that consists of (a) a user-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) device, (b) a smart analytics cloud that deploys models for blood glucose estimation, and (c) an end-to-end mobile/web application for monitoring diabetes patients. Blood glucose computation is achieved using a novel light-weight 1-dimensional input-reinforced deep neural network architecture, which we call as GlucoNet. This captures both long and short, temporal and spatial features from the PPG signal. The training and validation of the model were conducted on a dataset of 283 participants which demonstrated a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 17.8% (± 12.8%) wherein 100% of predictions fall in the clinically acceptable zones A and B of the Clarke-error grid. The lightweight model is also deployed on edge devices for real-time and offline blood glucose measurement. We report a clinical outcome deployment study and insights from 20,000＋ glucose measurements obtained from another 600 patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest reported work employing a non-calibrated, non-invasive, demography, and time-of-food agnostic IoMT glucose monitoring system that does not require any feature engineering and is capable of running on edge devices. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173231146"

Non-invasive techniques such as photoplethysmography (PPG) have been explored, though single-wavelength PPG systems are limited by the overlapping absorption characteristics between glucose and other biological components, such as water and fat. In this study, a novel multi-wavelength PPG system integrated with temperature and humidity sensors is introduced, coupled with a neural network framework featuring attention mechanisms to enhance glucose prediction. The system employs six optical sensors covering wavelengths from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, enabling deeper tissue penetration and enhanced glucose specificity by targeting distinct absorption peaks—especially those above 1000 nm. The system was validated using a robust dataset of 26,063 measurements from 254 participants. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, with the model achieving 86.49% compliance with the ISO 15197: 2013 standards and 91.80% of measurements falling within Zone A of the Parkes error grid. The introduction of multiple wavelengths clearly improves performance over single-wavelength systems, and wavelengths above 1000 nm were shown to have a higher contribution in glucose prediction. In addition, the incorporation of temperature and humidity data also enhanced performance by accounting for environmental and physiological factors, and that demographic and meal-related factors significantly impact prediction accuracy, thereby underscoring the potential of this system as a reliable, non-invasive, and personalized glucose monitoring tool. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002024225"

This requirement has led many researchers to develop efficient, accurate and easy estimation of blood glucose level without painful blood pricking or extraction. In line with this objective, this study is an effort for waveform analysis of autonomic response of photo pulse plethysmogram (PPG) and to evaluate PPG features that may provide better non-invasive detection of the disease. A total of 300 (150 diabetic and 150 control) subjects aged more than 18 years are considered for this study. Relevant patient details were obtained, and finger PPG recording in digital form was performed for 5 min with the digitization sampling rate of 200 sample points per second. After signal baseline correction, features are calculated from averaged normalized PPG and its first and second derivatives. A total of 41 features were derived from normalized PPG pulse and its derivatives for the assessment of hyperglycemia. But in practice, computation of many features is time-consuming and truly a tedious job for any model design. Further, model performance and accuracy are affected significantly. Applying six different statistical and machine learning methods for the identification of important features, 20 features were identified out of 41 features whose values are highly significantly different for control and study (diabetic) groups. This work was focused on feature extraction stage for a PPG-based diagnostic system.

The photoplethysmography signal, containing various physiological and pathological information, is widely used in various clinical studies and is also the focus of attention in the current implementation of the noninvasive glucose detection technique. Current studies of non-invasive blood glucose detection based on photoplethysmography signals have only considered the contribution to system modelling when the time or frequency domains act alone. Although the time domain analysis of the signal can describe the variation of the PPG signal amplitude with time, it cannot visually reflect the energy distribution of the PPG signal frequency. Therefore, the signal analysis of a single domain cannot fully express the PPG signal, which leads to information loss. When using frequency domain analysis to extract the signal spectrum, it is necessary to use all the time domain information of the signal, which is a global transformation and may result in the loss of signal characteristics at a specific time or in a specific frequency band. In summary, this paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on the integrated time-frequency domain analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG), using a parallel time-frequency domain method to consider the association between the photoplethysmography signal and blood glucose, a cluster analysis method is used to extract representative waveforms in the time domain of the PPG signal, analyze the correlation between the waveform features and blood glucose, and determine the time domain feature parameters of the waveform. On this basis, the pulse waveform time domain signal is converted to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform, and the spectral information is studied using principal component analysis to establish the frequency domain characteristic quantities. The BP neural network-based non-invasive blood glucose detection model is constructed by extracting the time-frequency domain feature parameters from the waveform signals obtained through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and using the invasive blood glucose concentration detected in real time as a reference. At the same time, in order to improve the accuracy of the model and achieve model optimization, a genetic algorithm is applied to the model for the second correction, and the final MAE and RMSE of the test set reach 1. 13 and 1. 42 mmol • L 1. The results of Parker's CEG show that the prediction results in the A and В regions accounted for 80. 3% and 19. 7% , respectively, which indicates that the method has good prediction accuracy and provides a theoretical basis for the feasibility of daily non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. It is beneficial to improve the detection and monitoring systems for diabetes, to judge the condition better comprehensively, and to prevent, guide, and treat diabetes promptly. © 2024 Science Press.

Recently, the growing demand for non-invasive, portable, cost-effective technology, along with advancements in small semiconductor components, has led to the integration of PPG into various wrist-worn wearable devices. Multiple sensor structures have been proposed and, through appropriate signal processing and algorithmic application, these wearable devices can measure a range of health indicators during daily life. This paper begins by addressing the market status of wrist-worn wearable devices, followed by an explanation of the fundamental principles underlying light operation and its interaction with living tissue for PPG measurements. Moving on to technological advancements, the paper addresses the analog front end for the measurement of the PPG signal, sensor configurations with multiple light emitters and receivers, the minimum sampling rate required for low-power systems, and the measurement of stress, sleep, blood pressure, blood glucose, and activity using PPG signals. Several challenges in the field are also identified, including selecting the appropriate wavelength for the PPG sensor’s light source, developing low-power interpolation methods to extract high-resolution inter-beat intervals at a low sampling rate, and exploring the measurement of physiological phenomena using multi-wavelength PPG signals simultaneously collected at the same location.

Diabetes stands as one of the world’s major chronic diseases. Untreated diabetes frequently leads to fatalities. Current self-monitoring techniques for measuring diabetes require invasive procedures such as blood or bodily fluid sampling, which may be very uncomfortable. Hence, there is an opportunity for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring through smart devices capable of measuring PPG signals. The primary goal of this research was to propose methods for glycemic classification into two groups (low and high glycemia) and to predict specific glycemia values using machine learning techniques. Two datasets were created by measuring PPG signals from 16 individuals using two different smart devices – a smart wristband and a smartphone. Simultaneously, the reference blood glucose levels were invasively measured using a glucometer. The PPG signals were preprocessed, and 27 different features were extracted. With the use of feature selection, only 10 relevant features were chosen. Numerous machine learning models were developed. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel performed best in classifying PPG signals into two groups. These models achieved an accuracy of 76% (SVM) and 75% (RF) on the smart wristband test dataset. The functionality of the proposed models was then verified on the smartphone test dataset, where both models achieved similar accuracy: 74% (SVM) and 75% (RF). For predicting specific glycemia values, RF performed best. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was 1.25 mmol/l on the smart wristband test dataset and 1.37 mmol/l on the smartphone test dataset. © 2023, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne.

Non-contact imaging photoplethysmography (IPPG) has caught much attention from biomedical researchers due to its non-invasive properties without the need for high-performance hardware devices. However, during non-contact imaging where subjects are less constrained, IPPG measurement results are susceptible to interference from rigid and non-rigid movements such as head turning, smiling, speaking and eyebrow raising, and unstable lighting. For improving the IPPG technique, we propose a region of interest (ROI) selection method with a concave lens deformation algorithm and skin color pixel clustering, and an adaptive normalized least mean square (NLMS) filtering algorithm for blood volume pulse (BVP). The proposed method improves accurate ROI extraction in less constrained conditions and the performance of filtering out non-physiological signal intensity fluctuations in ROI. Meanwhile, it has advantages in accuracy and stability under motion scenes and environments with large illumination variations, holding potential significance for non-contact heart rate monitoring in telemedicine, indoor fitness, psychological testing, and unmanned vehicles. Methods We obtain the subjects heart rates by processing the facial video images. First, the facial skin color region is distorted and expanded by adopting the concave lens deformation algorithm to increase the percentage of the skin pixel region. Next, the K-means++ clustering algorithm selects skin pixels again and builds RGB channels to estimate BVP signals. Subsequently, the chrominance-based color space projection decomposition (CHROM) algorithm is applied to pre-denoise the above-mentioned BVP signal. Finally, the proposed adaptive NLMS algorithm is employed to filter out the interference of background light, and then measure heart rate by spectrum analysis. In subsequent experiments, ablation experiments are conducted on the UBFC-rPPG dataset to verify that the improved ROI dynamic extraction method can enhance the accuracy of heart rate detection. In comparison experiments, on the same dataset, the results prove that the proposed method possesses stronger robustness to color signal fluctuations caused by the subject s head movements and facial expressions. Additionally, the results of the lighting fluctuation experiment where the light intensity of the doublearm lamp is continuously adjusted to simulate the changing light scene demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and Discussions In ablation experiments, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the improved ROI extraction method with a concave lens deformation algorithm and clustering algorithm amounts to 4.29 beats per minute (min-1), and the standard deviation (SD) is 2.59 min-1, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4.19% and the Pearson correlation coefficient r of 0.66. Our improved ROI selection method achieves the optimum in all the above-mentioned indexes. Integrated with the concave lens deformation algorithm and clustering algorithm, the proposed improved ROI dynamic extraction method can improve the accuracy of heart rate detection in less-constrained conditions (Table 1). The MAE of the proposed method is 0.92 min-1, MAPE is 1.57%, SD is 2.43 min-1, and r is 0.65 for the comparison experiments in motion scenarios, which is better than other unsupervised methods. Compared to the supervised learning methods, our method has advantages with low MAE and SD without the necessity for pre-learning and training (Table 2). Additionally, our proposed method has smaller confidence intervals, which means that the study is more robust to color signal fluctuations induced by head movements and facial expressions of the subjects (Fig. 5). In the experiments with drastic lighting changes, the proposed method still possesses smaller MAE, MAPE, and SD than others. The proposed adaptive NLMS method has been proven to be significantly feasible and effective in scenarios with varying lighting conditions (Table 3). By conducting Bland-Altman analysis, the bias of our proposed method is minimal with 95% confidence interval in the -7.8 min-1 to 7.8 min-1 (Fig. 6). Obviously, it indicates that our method is more robust in removing non-physiological signal fluctuations caused by illumination fluctuations. Conclusions To deal with the interference caused by normal physiological motion and ambient light in the IPPG technique, we propose an ROI dynamic extraction method integrated with the concave lens deformation algorithm, K-means++ clustering algorithm, and an adaptive NLMS algorithm on the BVP signals to improve the heart rate measuring stability and accuracy of this technique. Firstly, the concave lens deformation algorithm is adopted to compress facial features in each image frame, which in turn increases the pixel area of the facial skin ROI. Secondly, the K-means++ clustering method is employed to resieve the facial skin regions, build the ROI rich in physiological signals, and generate BVP signals with high signal-to-noise ratios. Thirdly, the CHROM algorithm is utilized to filter out the lighting interference caused by normal physiological motion, such as head movements and facial expressions, and further obtain first-filtered BVP signals. Fourthly, the adaptive NLMS algorithm based on the mean value of the first-filtered BVP signal is introduced for adaptively filtering out the non-physiological signals caused by illumination changes from this BVP signal. Finally, to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, we carry out the ablation experiments and comparison experiments between different algorithms on the UBFC-rPPG dataset and our dataset respectively. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several popular methods in the IPPG technique and solves the difficulty of accurate heart rate measurement under scenarios with large disturbances. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.

To address this issue, photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising non-invasive alternative for estimating blood glucose levels. In this study, we propose an innovative 1-second signal segmentation method and evaluate the performance of three advanced deep learning models using a novel dataset to estimate blood glucose levels from PPG signals. We also extend our testing to additional datasets to assess the robustness of our models against unseen distributions, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the models’ generalizability and specificity and accuracy. Initially, we analyzed 10-second PPG segments; however, our newly developed 1-second signal segmentation technique proved to significantly enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. The selected model, after being optimized and deployed on an embedded device, achieved immediate blood glucose estimation with a processing time of just 6.4 seconds, demonstrating the method’s practical applicability. The method demonstrated strong generalizability across different populations. Training data was collected during surgery and anesthesia, and the method also performed successfully in normal states using a separate test dataset. The results showed an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 19.7 mg/dL, with 76.6% accuracy within the A zone and 23.4% accuracy within the B zone of the Clarke Error Grid Analysis (CEGA), indicating a 100% clinical acceptance. These findings demonstrate that blood glucose estimation using 1-second PPG signal segments not only outperforms the traditional 10-second segments, but also provides a more convenient and accurate alternative to conventional monitoring methods.

Despite PB being electroactive, the pulse readout is advantageous over conventional steady-state power generation, providing up to a 15-fold increased signal-to-background ratio as well as dramatically improved sensitivity exceeding 10 A·M-1·cm-2 for H2O2 sensors and 3.9 A·M-1·cm-2 for glucose biosensors.

In this article, we aimed to construct a novel multimodal framework based on ECG and PPG signal fusion to establish a universal BG monitoring model. This is proposed as a spatiotemporal decision fusion strategy that uses weight-based Choquet integral for BG monitoring. Specifically, the multimodal framework performs three-level fusion. First, ECG and PPG signals are collected and coupled into different pools. Second, the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features in the ECG and PPG signals are extracted through numerical analysis and residual networks, respectively. Furthermore, the suitable temporal statistical features are determined with three feature selection techniques, and the spatial morphological features are compressed by deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, weight-based Choquet integral multimodel fusion is integrated for coupling different BG monitoring algorithms based on the temporal statistical features and spatial morphological features. To verify the feasibility of the model, a total of 103 days of ECG and PPG signals encompassing 21 participants were collected in this article. The BG levels of participants ranged between 2.2 and 21.8 mmol/L. The results obtained show that the proposed model has excellent BG monitoring performance with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.49 mmol/L, mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 13.42%, and Zone A + B of 99.49% in tenfold cross-validation.

Given the strong correlation between AS and various photoplethysmography (PPG) features, PPG emerges as a convenient method for assessing AS. However, the limitations of independent PPG features hinder detection accuracy. This study introduces a feature selection method leveraging the interactive relationships between features to enhance the accuracy of predicting AS from a single-channel PPG signal. Initially, an adaptive signal interception method was employed to capture high-quality signal fragments from PPG sequences. 58 PPG features, deemed to have potential contributions to AS estimation, were extracted and analyzed. Subsequently, the interaction factor (IF) was introduced to redefine the interaction and redundancy between features. A feature selection algorithm (IFFS) based on the IF was then proposed, resulting in a combination of interactive features. Finally, the Xgboost model is utilized to estimate AS from the selected features set. The proposed approach is evaluated on datasets of 268 male and 124 female subjects, respectively. The results of AS estimation indicate that IFFS yields interacting features from numerous sources, rejects redundant ones, and enhances the association. The interaction features combined with the Xgboost model resulted in an MAE of 122.42 and 142.12 cm/sec, an SDE of 88.16 and 102.56 cm/sec, and a PCC of 0.88 and 0.85 for the male and female groups, respectively.

Standard haemodynamic monitoring during anaesthesia relies on intermittent blood pressure and heart rate. Continuous monitoring systemic blood pressure requires invasive or advanced modalities creating a barrier for obtaining important information of the circulation. The Peripheral Perfusion Index (PPI) is obtained non-invasively and continuously by standard photoplethysmography. We hypothesized that different patterns of changes in systemic haemodynamics during induction of general anaesthesia would be reflected in the PPI. Continuous values of PPI, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated in 107 patients by either minimally invasive or non-invasive means in a mixed population of surgical patients. 2 min after induction of general anaesthesia relative changes of SV, CO, and MAP was compared to the relative changes of PPI. After induction total cohort mean(± st.dev.) MAP, SV, and CO decreased to 65(± 16)%, 74(± 18)%, and 63(± 16)% of baseline values. In the 38 patients where PPI decreased MAP was 57(± 14)%, SV was 63(± 18)%, and CO was 55(± 18)% of baseline values 2 min after induction. In the 69 patients where PPI increased the corresponding values were MAP 70(± 15)%, SV 80(± 16)%, and CO 68(± 17)% (all differences: p < 0,001). During induction of general anaesthesia changes in PPI discriminated between the degrees of reduction in blood pressure and algorithm derived cardiac stroke volume and -output. As such, the PPI has potential to be a simple and non-invasive indicator of the degree of post-induction haemodynamic changes. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161370035"

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a helpful technique that can be used to measure blood-glucose concentration without a blood sample. To facilitate such noninvasive in-vivo estimation, we propose a model based on the Beer-Lambert law for measuring blood-glucose concentration using the PPG signal. Notably, only two wavelengths are used. First, the oxygen saturation (SpO2) is estimated from the ratio of absorbance at two wavelengths, then another absorbance ratio is presented, and the blood-glucose concentration is estimated by substituting the SpO2 estimated earlier to this ratio. The PPG signals from 40 subjects were collected along with their reference blood-glucose concentrations and SpO2 values. The PPG-based blood-glucose concentrations are then calculated using mathematical equations derived from the Beer-Lambert law. A supervised machine learning model, XGBoost, is applied to calibrate the estimation model with the reference values measured using a commercial device; according to our experimental results, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) value is 0.85. The proposed model based on the Beer-Lambert law thus provides a method for in-vivo estimation of blood glucose in daily applications. © 2023, Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences.

A novel non-invasive device for classifying blood sugar level is developed using a Near-Infrared sensor (NIR). Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, which are sensitive to blood glucose levels, are acquired using NIR sensors. ANOVA statistical analysis is used to identify significant features from the PPG signal. Quadratic SVM provided better results for features such as first derivative crest, time of inflection, and age in classifying the diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.

There is a need for early diagnosis and risk stratification to implement an overall risk management strategy. Presently, the conventional method is not suitable for large-scale screening. The primary aim of this study is to develop an automated diagnostic system that uses Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals for the non-invasive diagnosis of hypertension and DM-II. The proposed model uses a statistical feature extracted by decomposing the PPG signal up to level 11 into a sub-band using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a variety of classifiers are used for the classification of hypertension and detection of DM-II patients. Three feature selection techniques used are Spearman correlation, ReliefF and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) to select 20 top features out of 130 features using correlation with systole blood pressure (SBP), diastole blood pressure (DBP) values and D-II. The highest accuracy attained by the Adaptive neural fuzzy system (ANFIS) for classification categories such as normal (NT) vs prehypertension(PHT), NT vs. hypertension type 1 (HT-I), NT vs hypertension type 2 (HT-II) in terms of F1 score are 92.%, 98.5%, 98.3% (SBP) and 83.1%, 95.6%, 86.8% (DBP),respectively. The accuracy achieved by the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the classification of normal (non-diabetic) vs. diabetic patients is 99.1%. The hybrid learning algorithm-based classifier achieved higher accuracy for hypertension risk stratification as compared to the hard computing classifier, which requires parameter tuning and DWT decomposition is robust to the noisy signal, overcoming the limitation of the morphological feature-based model. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164356332"

The extracted signal features were correlated with the subject's glucose level, which was measured at the same time using a commercial glucometer, and several regression models were constructed. The models were evaluated using signals from up to 110 subjects across three datasets, and the most optimized model was implemented in the device to predict the subject's blood glucose level solely based on PPG in real-time.

However, the optical absorption change induced by blood glucose is weak in the NIR region and often masked by interference from other components such as water and hemoglobin. Aim: Instead of using direct optical absorption by glucose, this study proposes an index calculated from oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals that shows a good correlation with BGLs while using conventional visible and NIR spectroscopy. Approach: The metabolic index, which is based on tissue oxygen consumption, was derived through analytical methods and further verified and reproduced in a series of glucose challenge experiments. Blood glucose estimation units were prototyped by utilizing commercially available smart devices. Results: Our experimental results showed that the phase delay between the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signals in near-infrared spectroscopy correlates with BGL measured by a conventional continuous glucose monitor. The proposed method was also confirmed to work well with visible spectroscopy systems based on smartphone cameras. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent repeatability in results from a total of 19 oral challenge tests. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of non-invasive glucose monitoring using existing photoplethysmography sensors for pulse oximeters and smartwatches.

However, this enhancement came at the cost of requiring an additional HbA1c measurement, thus being unfriendly to users. In this study, the enhanced HbA1c NIBG deep learning model (blood glucose level predicted from PPG and HbA1c) was trained with 1494 measurements, and we replaced the HbA1c measurement (explicit HbA1c) with “implicit HbA1c” which is reversely derived from pretested PPG and finger-pricked blood glucose levels. The implicit HbA1c is then evaluated across intervals up to 90 days since the pretest, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy, while the remaining 13% falls near the CEG zone A boundary. The implicit HbA1c approach exhibits a remarkable 16% improvement over the explicit HbA1c method by covering personal correction items automatically. This improvement not only refines the accuracy of the model but also enhances the practicality of the previously proposed model that relied on an HbA1c input.

However, it is difficult to deploy broadly in primary care settings due to its high cost and time-consuming. This study proposed a fast and inexpensive technique for predicting TcPO2 using the characteristic features of the photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and various machine learning algorithms. Methods: The toe PPG signals of 149 subjects were collected, and 12 characteristic features were extracted according to contour analysis, followed by TcPO2 measurements. TcPO2 measurements were performed on the dorsum of the foot by PeriFlux 6000 TcPO2 system. In addition to PPG features, physiological parameters were also taken into account. A variety of machine learning regression approaches, including extreme gradient boost (XGBoost), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR) and Ridge regression (Ridge), were used to predict TcPO2 levels. To evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, different performance indicators such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient were employed. Correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plot analysis were performed to visualize the data. Results: XGBoost outperformed the other three regression models in predicting TcPO2 (R = 0.835, MAE = 5.23 mmHg, RMSE = 6.87 mmHg, MAPE = 9.99%). Reflection index, diabetes, duration of diabetes, heart rate, crest time, the time between the systolic and diastolic peaks (ΔT) were the top six contributions to TcPO2 prediction in the XGBoost model. The PPG characteristic features play a dominant role in TcPO2 estimation. Diabetes and duration of diabetes were also significant factors in TcPO2 prediction. Conclusions: We compared four machine learning methods for TcPO2 prediction. The XGBoost model had the best predictive performance of all the algorithms investigated and could be used to forecast TcPO2 values.

Third, the extraction method of the dynamic optical rotation angle in this paper is to extract the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the optical rotation angle from each cycle of the signal of the continuous cyclic change of the length of the optical path, and the accumulated value of the difference of multiple cycles is recorded as the dynamic optical rotation angle, which not only reduces the errors caused by the individual differences, the external environment and the measuring instrument, but also has the effect of averaging and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical rotation angle. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, human finger real and simulation experiments are carried out, respectively. Firstly, the polarization camera is used to collect the image data of elliptically polarized light of nine different wavelengths of linearly polarized light after passing through the human body's finger, and obtains the optical rotation angle under each wavelength that changes with the photoplethysmography (PPG) through data processing, and extracts the dynamic optical rotation angles of the nine wavelengths by the extraction method, and the human body's blood glucose can be quantitatively analyzed. Secondly, this paper builds a simulation model to simulate the blood volume conversion of the human finger, and uses the simulation experimental system to collect the dynamic optical rotation angles of nine wavelengths of a total of 137 human serum samples, and uses partial least squares regression to establish a model between the dynamic optical rotation angles and blood glucose concentration. In the results of predicting all samples using the model, the correlation coefficient and root mean square error were 0.7960 and 2.16 mmol/L, respectively, both of which improved by 137.26 % and decreased by 35.33 %, respectively, compared to the existing method. The experimental results show that the method in this paper has high accuracy in detecting the blood glucose concentration in human beings, which is of great significance in realizing the noninvasive quantitative analysis of human blood glucose components by the polarized light method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207010407"

Blood pressure, a critical indicator of hypertension, is typically measured intermittently, which limits continuous monitoring. This study explores the development of a prototype for continuous blood pressure monitoring using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. By analyzing vascular contraction signals, we modeled blood pressure through three key PPG features: heart rate, average normal-to-normal intervals, and mean envelope size. Data from 35 participants were collected at rest and post-exercise. Using a two-variable linear regression equation, we found that the combination of heart rate and mean envelope size provided the most accurate systolic blood pressure estimates, with a mean error of 8.58% ± 5.81.

Kaplan-Meier curves of the DR risk indicator was analyzed. In addition, the correlation between the measurements of the radial pulse and PPG was evaluated. Results: In comparison of the patients' clinical characteristics, years of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, ACR, urinary albumin and fourth harmonic (C4) were higher in the DR group, and eGFR and third harmonic (C3) were lower. Patients in the high-DR risk group had a 1.8-fold higher risk of developing retinopathy than those in the low-risk group (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework, entitled cocktail causal container, to fuse multiple physiological representations and to reconstruct the correlation between frequency and temporal information during multi-task learning. Cocktail causal container processes hematologic reflex information to classify blood pressure and blood glucose.

A causal net is used to analyze the fused higher-order information, so that the framework can be enforced to disentangle the latent factors into the related endogenous association that corresponds to down-stream fusion information to improve the semantic interpretation. Moreover, a pair-wise temporal frequency map is developed to provide valuable insights into extraction of salient photoplethysmograph (PPG) information from fingertip videos obtained by a standard smartphone camera. Extensive comparisons have been implemented for the validation of cocktail causal container using a Clinical dataset and PPG-BP benchmark.

Blood glucose level (BGL) is usually monitored by collecting a blood sample and assessing the results. This type of measurement is extremely unpleasant and inconvenient for the patient, who must undergo it frequently. This paper proposes a novel real-time, non-invasive technique for estimating BGL with smartphone photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal extracted from fingertip video and deep neural networks (DNN). Fingertip videos are collected from 93 subjects using a smartphone camera and a lighting source, and subsequently the frames are converted into PPG signal. The PPG signals have been preprocessed with Butterworth bandpass filter to eliminate high frequency noise, and motion artifact. Therefore, there are 34 features that are derived from the PPG signal and its derivatives and Fourier transformed form. In addition, age and gender are also included as features due to their considerable influence on glucose. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) feature selection technique has been applied for selecting the best feature set for obtaining good accuracy. Finally, the DNN model has been established to determine BGL non-invasively.

We aimed to investigate changes in the pleth variability index (PVI), vena cava collapsibility index (VCCI), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in spontaneously breathing volunteers after acute loss of 450 mL blood and passive leg raise (PLR). Methods This prospective observational study enrolled healthy volunteers in the blood donation center of an academic hospital. We measured the PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP before blood donation; at the 0th and 10th minute of blood donation; and after PLR. The primary outcome was the changes in PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP. Results We enrolled thirty volunteers. There were significant differences among the four obtained measurements of the PVI, EtCO2, and MAP (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Compared to the predonation values, post-hoc analysis revealed an increase in the PVI at the 0th min postdonation (mean difference [MD], 5.4±5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.6 to -3.1; P<0.001); a decrease in the EtCO2 and MAP at the 0th and 10th minute postdonation, respectively (MD, 2.4±4.6; 95% CI, 0.019 to 4.84; P=0.008 and MD, 6.4±6.4; 95% CI, 3 to 9.7; P<0.001, respectively). Compared with EtCO2 at the 10th minute, the value increased after PLR (MD, 1.8±3.2; 95% CI, 0.074 to 4.44; P=0.006). Conclusion The PVI and EtCO2 could detect early hemodynamic changes after acute blood loss.

Insufficient management of this disease can lead to various medical complications, including vision loss and limb amputation. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is crucial for effective diabetes management. However, current one-time glucose monitoring methods still rely on invasive techniques, causing pain and lacking continuous monitoring capability. This study aims to develop a non-invasive technology for measuring blood glucose levels that can be conveniently monitored through a smartphone using wireless communication. The device utilizes an ESP32 microprocessor and a PPG MAX 30102 sensor capable of recording pulse waves, a biomarker, at the fingertips. In this preliminary study, non-invasive data from 22 participants were used and divided into three classes according to conventional invasive measurements. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models, were utilized to achieve convergence between the conventional invasive measurements and the proposed approach. The trained model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 0.944, with a minimum model loss of 0.177. In the validation phase, the proposed approach proved its reliability by achieving an average accuracy of 0.750. The non-invasive approach has the potential to provide a convenient and pain-free alternative to traditional monitoring methods, significantly enhancing diabetes management and improving the overall quality of life for those affected by this condition. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181541277"

The non-contact measurement method can avoid these problems. In this paper, a non-contact blood glucose detection method based on a near-infrared camera is proposed. Blood glucose has a strong absorption capacity in the near-infrared band, and other components in blood (water, hemoglobin, etc.) have different absorption characteristics in this band compared with blood glucose. Therefore, in this method, we realize blood glucose detection by receiving the near-infrared light reflected back after blood glucose absorption. We extracted 26 pulse wave features from the pulse wave and analyzed 6 that were highly correlated with blood glucose. Then, four kinds of machine learning algorithms (PCR, PLS, SVR, RFR) were used to build models respectively, and the RFR with the best performance was selected to build the final blood glucose prediction model. Finally, the experimental results are analyzed by Clark error grid analysis, which shows that the proposed method is in good agreement with the reference glucose monitor. Compared with traditional invasive blood glucose detection methods, the non-contact blood glucose detection method has more application prospects. © 2022","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138033764"

Individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension are at a greater risk for developing the same sequela. Autonomic cardiac control is important in the level of cardiac function. One intervention that is effective in improving cardiovascular function is heart rate variability biofeedback training. The purpose of our study was to determine the effectiveness of heart rate biofeedback training on HRV and blood pressure in individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease. Methods: Thirty-four participants (76.5% female, 22.7 ± 4.3 years) completed a baseline assessment and training using an established short-term HRV protocol followed by two weeks of at-home paced breathing employing a smartphone application. The participants were then reassessed in a biofeedback clinic. Results: The participants physiological measures showed a significant increase in means between pre and post intervention of SDNN (t (32) = 2.177, p =.037) and TP, (t (32) = 2.327 p =.026). Correlation noted a medium effect on diastolic blood pressure and high frequency heart rate variability, F, r =.41, n =33, p <.05. A multiple regression with all predictor variables in the model found no significance with diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: The findings from this pilot study demonstrated that a two-week paced breathing intervention may assist in reducing heart rate and diastolic blood pressure while improving heart rate variability. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122969687"

To overcome these long-standing problems, we largely enhanced the training efficiency with the limited personal data by an innovative Deduction Learning (DL), instead of the conventional Induction Learning (IL). The domain theory of our deductive method, DL, made use of accumulated comparison of paired inputs leading to corrections to preceded measured blood glucose to construct our deep neural network architecture. DL method involves the use of paired adjacent rounds of finger pulsation Photoplethysmography signal recordings as the input to a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) based deep learning model. Our study reveals that CNN filters of DL model generated extra and non-uniform feature patterns than that of IL models, which suggests DL is superior to IL in terms of learning efficiency under limited training data. Among 30 diabetic patients as our recruited volunteers, DL model achieved 80% of test prediction in zone A of Clarke Error Grid (CEG) for model training with 12 rounds of data, which was 20% improvement over IL method. Furthermore, we developed an automatic screening algorithm to delete low confidence outlier predictions. With only a dozen rounds of training data, DL with automatic screening achieved a correlation coefficient (RP) of 0.81, an accuracy score (RA) of 93.5, a root mean squared error of 13.93 mg/dl, a mean absolute error of 12.07 mg/dl, and 100% predictions in zone A of CEG. The nonparametric Wilcoxon paired test on RA for DL versus IL revealed near significant difference with p-value 0.06. These significant improvements indicate that a very simple and precise noninvasive measurement of blood glucose concentration is achievable. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128544856"

Early diagnosis of CAD requires a combination of multiple tests including a 12-lead ECG test, blood test, and stress test before the patient can go through a more complex procedure such as coronary computed tomography angiography or invasive coronary angiography procedure. The study aims to investigate the association between common parameters from the preliminary test of CAD to the severity of stenosis in the coronary arteries among newly diagnosed IHD patients. A total of 80 CAD patients (55 ± 9.52 years) have participated in this study and their demographic data, vital signs, blood tests, as well as ECG result are taken just before they are going for the angiography procedure. It was found that 75% of the subjects are overweight. The results also showed that the number of patients who smoke, have diabetes, and have hypertension is higher in the case group (stenosis ≥ 70%) as compared to the control group (stenosis < 70%). There was no clinical data that can differentiate severe stenosis in the coronary arteries, except for fasting blood sugar (p=0.002). Subjects with severely blocked arteries tend to have higher levels of blood sugar with a mean of 8.05 ± 3.60. Framingham risk scores (FRS) for both groups were also compared, and it is found that 59% of the total subjects have low FRS, even though half of them have severe stenosis. Thus, a technical approach is required to determine the stenosis level in the coronary arteries.

Thus, monitoring blood glucose levels and the diagnosis of diabetes in the early stages is very important. Nonin-vasive in vivo diabetes-diagnosis procedures are very new and require thorough studies to be error-resistant and user-friendly. In this study, we compare two noninvasive procedures (two-wave-length-and three-wavelength-based methods) to estimate glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in different scenarios and evaluate them with error level calculations. The three-wavelength method, which has more model parameters, results in a more accurate estimation of HbA1c even when the blood oxygenation (SpO2) values change. The HbA1c-estimation error range of the two-wavelength model, due to change in SpO2, is found to be from −1.306% to 0.047%. On the other hand, the HbA1c estimation error for the three-wavelength model is found to be in the magnitude of 10−14% and in-dependent of SpO2. The approximation of SpO2 from the two-wavelength model produces a lower error for the molar concentration based technique (−4% to −1.9% at 70% to 100% of reference SpO2) as compared to the molar absorption coefficient based technique. Additionally, the two-wavelength model is less susceptible to sensor noise levels (max SD of %error, 0.142%), as compared to the three-wavelength model (max SD of %error, 0.317%). Despite having a higher susceptibility to sensor noise, the three-wavelength model can estimate HbA1c values more accurately; this is because it takes the major components of blood into account and thus becomes a more realistic model. © 2021 by the authors.

Precision management of hypertension is important, because both susceptibility to complications and response to treatment vary between individuals. While the use of genomic and proteomic personal features for widespread precision hypertension management is not practical, other features, such as age, ethnicity, and cardiovascular diseases, have been utilized in guidelines for hypertension management. In precision medicine, more blood-pressure-related clinical and physiological characteristics in the patient’s profile can be utilized for the determination of the threshold of hypertension and optimal treatment. Several non-invasive and simple-to-use techniques for the measurement of hypertension-related physiological features are suggested for use in precision management of hypertension. In order to provide precise management of hypertension, accurate measurement of blood pressure is required, but the available non-invasive blood pressure measurement techniques, auscultatory sphygmomanometry and oscillometry, have inherent significant inaccuracy—either functional or technological—limiting the precision of personalized management of hypertension. A novel photoplethysmography-based technique for the measurement of systolic blood pressure that was recently found to be more accurate than the two available techniques can be utilized for more precise and personalized hypertension management. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141864954"

At present, we need at least two devices such as electrocardiography (ECG) device and invasive BGL measuring devices to measure heart rate and blood glucose level accurately which are costly. In this paper, an easy method has been described to measure both HR and BGL values simultaneously without pricking a finger and without a trained person using a single device only based on photoplethysmography (PPG). In this research work, a pulse sensor is used for PPG signal collection. Then this PPG signal is passed through a bandpass filter for noise removal and amplification to the microcontroller unit (MCU). Then the data obtained from MCU are analyzed using MATLAB for finding HR and BGL values. The peak finding technique is used for finding HR value. For determining BGL values, the dominant feature of the PPG signal is extracted which has the highest correlation with BGL, and then using regression analysis a relationship is established from which we can measure the BGL values without pricking blood. Finally, correlation analysis is also done to analyze the relationship between HR and BGL. As PPG signal acquisition is less costly than ECG and other BGL measuring methods, it will be very helpful for determining HR and BGL values simultaneously at ease. Thus this research work will provide opportunities for early diagnosis of problems related to heart rate and blood glucose level.  © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104574631"

Firstly, a digital bandpass filter is designed to remove the noise from the raw signal. Afterward, various parameters of the filtered signal are analyzed and the correlation between the parameters and blood glucose level is determined. Then, using multiple regression, a model has been established to estimate the blood glucose level. Finally, the predicted value obtained using multiple regression analysis was compared to the actual blood glucose value obtained from the invasive technique and to the predicted value obtained using simple linear regression analysis. It was found that percentage deviation lies within 8% in a multiple regression based model that ensures the model's accuracy and for every subject, the percentage deviation in this model is less than the percentage deviation obtained in the single parameter-based model. As this research work uses a PPG signal that is comfortable to use and the accuracy of the multiple parameter based model is higher than the single parameter based model, it will be very effective to estimate blood glucose level easily and accurately.  © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115705442"

As illustrated in this work, we increased the number subjects recruited to 2538 and found that the prediction accuracy (the ratio in zone A of Clarke’s error grid) reduced to undesirable 60.6%. We suspect the low prediction accuracy induced by larger sample size might arise from the physiological diversity of subjects, and one possibility is that the diversity might originate from medication. Therefore, we split the subjects into two cohorts for deep learning: with and without medication (1682 and 856 recruited subjects, respectively). In comparison, the cohort training for subjects without any medication had approximately 30% higher prediction accuracy over the cohort training for those with medication. Further-more, by adding quarterly (every 3 months) measured glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), we were able to significantly boost the prediction accuracy by approximately 10%. For subjects without medication, the best performing model with quarterly measured HbA1c achieved 94.3% prediction accuracy, RMSE of 12.4 mg/dL, MAE of 8.9 mg/dL, and MAPE of 0.08, which demonstrates a very promising solution for NIBG prediction via deep learning.

However, researches have been done to prove the usage of pulse oximeter to measure the blood glucose level besides other physiological indicators such as heart rate, percentage of blood oxygen, etc. Here, as the first of two studies, we try to develop an all-purpose commercial prototype photoplethysmography (PPG) system to monitor necessary health indicator parameters in a non-invasive way.

These methods may be painful and put the patient at risk for infection. These procedures may cause fear in the children. In order to address this issue, we suggest a non-invasive method that combines ISEs, PPG, and infrared (IR) sensors to measure salt, glucose, and hemoglobin levels. By studying the absorption and reflection of infrared light by blood vessels in the subcutaneous tissue, the IR sensor will be used to detect the amount of glucose in the body. PPG operates by measuring the pulsatile blood flow through the arteries, which will reveal information about hemoglobin levels. Lastly, an ISEs sensor will be used to measure sweat pH, which is correlated with sodium concentration, in order to monitor salt levels. Advanced machine learning techniques will be used to interpret the data from these sensors and deliver precise, real-time measures of sodium, hemoglobin, and glucose. To further assess the patient's breathing condition, we have added a breathe analyzer. The IR sensor yields the breathing analyzer output. By using a thermometer, we may analyze the patient's breaths per minute using a graphical waveform, with the breaths taken in a minute being represented by the peak value.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184992662"

It causes an irreversible damage to the human organs and even leads to the death. Moreover, for the mortality due to the COVID19, it was found that the death rate of the subjects with the diabetes is higher than that without the diabetes. Therefore, monitoring the blood glucose values is very important. Since the non-invasive blood glucose estimation does not introduce the pain to the subjects and it can reduce the risk of the infection, the non-invasive blood glucose estimation techniques were recently developed. However, it is based on the photoplethysmograms (PPGs). Nevertheless, the PPGs are contaminated by the noise. Hence, performing the denoising is critical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Slant transform based bit plane denoising method to improve the quality of the PPGs. First, the Slant transform is applied to the PPGs. Second, each Slant transform coefficient is represented using a finite number of bits. Third, some bits of the Slant transform coefficients are discarded. Fourth, the inverse Slant transform is applied to the processed PPGs. To perform the blood glucose estimation, the heart rates are extracted from the denoised PPGs and the heart rate variabilities are calculated. They are taken as the features. Then, the feature vectors and the corresponding invasive blood glucose values are used to train a random forest regression model. For the test PPGs, the non-invasive blood glucose values are estimated based on the established model. Compared to the states of the art methods, it is found that our proposed method can effectively improve the ability of estimation. In particular, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and the percentage of the data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid yielded by our proposed method reaches 15.34%, and 75.86%, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163311724"

Currently, only invasive monitoring methods are commercially available. These methods have significant disadvantages as patients experience discomfort while obtaining blood samples. A non-invasive method of blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring that is painless and low-cost would address the limitations of invasive techniques. Photoplethysmography (PPG) collects a signal from a finger sensor using a photodiode, and a nearby infrared LED light. The combination of the PPG electronic circuit with artificial intelligence makes it possible to implement the classification of BGL. However, one major constraint of deep learning is the long training phase. We try to overcome this limitation and offer a concept for classifying type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a machine learning algorithm based on PPG. We gathered 400 raw datasets of BGL measured with PPG and divided these points into two classification levels, according to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, namely, “normal” and “diabetes”.

This paper proposes a blood glucose (BG) prediction model for more precise prediction based on BG series decomposition by complete aggregation empirical mode decomposition based on adaptive white noise (CEEMDAN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) that is optimized by improved bacterial foraging optimization (IBFO). Hierarchical clustering technology recombines the decomposed BG series according to their sample entropy and the correlations with the original BG trends. Dynamic BG trends are regressed separately for each recombined BG series by the GRU model to realize the more precise estimations, which are optimized by IBFO for its structure and superparameters. Through experiments, the optimized and basic LSTM, RNN, and support vector regression (SVR) are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the 15-min IBFO-GRU prediction is improved on average by about 13.1% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with those of the RNN and LSTM optimized by IBFO. Meanwhile, the proposed model improved the Clarke error grid results by about 2.6% and 5.0% compared with those of the IBFO-LSTM and IBFO-RNN in 30-min prediction and by 4.1% and 6.6% in 15-min ahead forecast, respectively. The evaluation outcomes of our proposed CEEMDAN-IBFO-GRU model have high accuracy and adaptability and can effectively provide early intervention control of the occurrence of hyperglycemic complications.  © 2022 Yongjun Zhang and Guangheng Gao.","Retracted","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128628958"

In the presence of noncompressible arteries, the ankle brachial index (ABI) can either be inconclusive or provide false-positive results. Toe pressure measurement has been suggested as an alternative as a noninvasive method for detecting peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Toe pressure measurement can be performed either by photoplethysmography (PPG) or by Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The aim of this study was to determine correlations between the two techniques in order to promote the use of PPG in clinical practice. Methods: This was a prospective correlational study of 108 consecutive recruited adult patients, with and without diabetes, with at least one lower limb wound from a University-affiliated hospital wound care clinic. Toe pressure measurements were both performed with PPG and LDF devices. Results: Mean toe pressure values for PPG and LDF were, respectively, 83.7 (SD 35.4) and 79.5 (SD 32.0) mmHg (with a paired t-test 3.969, P < 0.01). In patients with at least one lower limb wound, a strong linear relation was found between PPG and LDF toe pressure techniques with a Pearson’s r correlation coefficient of 0.920 (P < 0.001). Conclusions: PPG and LDF toe pressure techniques are equivalent in patients with at least one lower limb wound, irrespective of the presence of diabetes. Therefore, in the presence of an ABI with inconclusive results, such as in a patient with noncompressible vessels, both toe pressure techniques can be used for assessing the vascular supply of the lower limb with a wound. © 2020 Diabetes Technology Society.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097938158"

The most common way is through an invasive blood test that causes pain, fear, discomfort and an important economic impact. Recent studies have shown a correlation between heart rate variability (HRV) and glucose levels, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia. This research aimed at designing a machine learning algorithm for glucose level detection using HRV features. Methods: We acquired physiological and clinical data from 5, yielding 100 observations. Then, we detected peaks from a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and evaluated the peak detection accuracy. Afterwards, we measured multiple HRV-related features from such peaks. Then, data was curated, and relevant features were selected. After that, hyperparameters were optimized for 5 different estimators, and such values were used to create and evaluate predictive models. Results: The PPG peak detection algorithm performed efficiently, with an above 99% precision. The feature selection process yielded 20 features, 65% of them were HRV-related. The best model for glucose level detection was an ensemble between a Support Vector Machine, a Lasso and an Elasticnet model, with a mean absolute error of 16.24 mg/dL. Discussion: HRV features were very important to detect glucose levels. But fatigue, blood pressure and BMI were also included in the final model. We were limited by the size of the dataset, but our results are promising and HRV should be further explored as an indirect way of measuring blood glucose concentration. Additionally, and unlike similar studies in which HRV was measured from medical-grade electrocardiogram equipment, we measured HRV features from a PPG signal obtained using a commercial pulse oximeter. This would allow not only for a non-invasive glucose level measuring, but for it to be performed in a non-clinical setting. © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104898266"

People with diabetes need regular checks of their blood glucose levels to keep track of them and maintain them in healthy ranges. These regular checks are expensive in terms of the consumables being used to perform the tests, i.e., test strips and prick needles, as they are changed every time a test is conducted. Also, the discomfort and pain during the sample collection and the risk of getting an infection are high. This calls for non- invasive methods of blood glucose testing where the test can be done without the need to draw blood. This study uses the Max30102 biosensor, which is a pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor as a non-invasive device to test blood sugar levels by acquiring samples from the patient. The choice of this sensor is informed by studies showing that even during the early stages of diabetes mellitus type 2, there is a change in blood vessels and this in turn affects the pulse rate. The solution showed a positive correlation comparison between the acquired data from volunteers using the non-invasive device and invasive glucometer data from the same volunteers. The results were able to prove the feasibility of the device to test diabetes type 2 without the need to invasively get the samples. However, a lot of data is required to be collected for correlation and comparison using different types of Infrared biosensors having different wavelengths to get high precision and accuracy.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164264190"

Furthermore, such old methods need the use of heavy equipment, blood draws, and traditional bench-top testing procedures. Invasive ways of acquiring test samples can potentially cause patient discomfort and anguish. Wearable sensors, on the other hand, may be attached to numerous body areas to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics as a developing analytical tool. Physical, chemical, and biological data transferred via the skin are used to monitor health in various circumstances. Wearable sensors can assess the aberrant conditions of the physical or chemical components of the human body in real time, exposing the body state in time, thanks to unintrusive sampling and high accuracy. Most commercially available wearable gadgets are mechanically hard components attached to bands and worn on the wrist, with form factors ultimately constrained by the size and weight of the batteries required for the power supply. Basic physiological signals comprise a lot of health-related data. The estimation of critical physiological characteristics, such as pulse inconstancy or variability using photoplethysmography (PPG) and oxygen saturation in arterial blood using pulse oximetry, is possible by utilizing an analysis of the pulsatile component of the bloodstream. Wearable gadgets with “skin-like” qualities are a new type of automation that is only starting to make its way out of research labs and into pre-commercial prototypes. Flexible skin-like sensing devices have accomplished several functionalities previously inaccessible for typical sensing devices due to their deformability, lightness, portability, and flexibility. In this paper, we studied the recent advancement in battery-powered wearable sensors established on optical phenomena and skin-like battery-free sensors, which brings a breakthrough in wearable sensing automation. © 2022 by the authors.

Monitoring of Blood glucose levels is one of the important physiological information for medical professionals. Non-invasive detection of blood glucose levels is necessary for monitoring and managing diabetes and reducing the need for frequent finger pricks as invasive methods. Non-invasive measurement of blood glucose provides a convenient and pain-free alternative to traditional invasive methods. The traditional methods require pricking of the finger for taking blood samples and calibration for proper results. Non-calibrated devices can lead to faulty results. In this study, a photo detector-based approach is used to measure the blood glucose level. The system is based on a photodetector sensor that detects the changes in light absorption caused by variations in blood glucose levels. In this study, we performed experiments on two sets of groups, one with normal and the other with fasting state to compare the invasive and non-invasive values of glucose in different subjects to make a standard non-invasive glucometer system. The evaluation was conducted on a group of participants before and after the ingestion of glucose during the procedure. The sensor was placed superficially on the fingertip to acquire the photoplethysmography signal along with the traditional measurement method for reference blood glucose values. The MATLAB-based algorithm has been designed to further filter and process the signal and measure the blood glucose level. The results indicate a strong correlation between photoplethysmography detector-based measurement and the reference blood glucose levels. The non-invasive method exhibited promising accuracy and reliability in estimating blood glucose concentrations. The proposed approach provides a non-invasive measurement of blood glucose level which improves the quality of life for individuals with diabetes. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208102500"

Convenient and accurate blood pressure and blood glucose measurements are increasingly popular. In this paper, the estimation of non-invasive blood glucose and CuffLess blood pressure are achieved by collecting the PPG signals of 20 volunteers and the PPG signals of 200 patients obtained from the MIMIC-II database, respectively. The experimental results show: on the blood glucose dataset, the TAS model proposed in this paper achieved a standard error of prediction SEP =10.90mg/dL, Pearson correlation coefficient R=0.93, and determination coefficient R2=0.86, and 93.94% of the prediction points are located in A when the clinical safety of the model effect is evaluated with a Clark error grid region.

At this time, the only commercially viable monitoring methods that exist are invasive ones. Since patients are uncomfortable while blood samples are being taken, these techniques have significant disadvantages. The drawbacks of invasive treatments might be overcome by a painless, inexpensive, non-invasive approach to blood glucose level (BGL) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals obtained from sensor leads placed on specific organ tissues are collected using photodiodes and nearby infrared LEDs. Cardiovascular disease can be detected via photoplethysmography. These characteristics can be used to directly affect BGL monitoring in diabetic patients if PPG signals are used. The Guilin People’s Hospital’s open database was used to produce the data collection. The dataset was gathered from 219 adult respondents spanning an age range from 21 to 86 of which 48 percent were male. There were 2100 sampling points total for each PPG data segment. The methodology of feature extraction from data may assist in increasing the effectiveness of classifier training and testing. PPG data information is modified in the frequency domain by the instantaneous frequency (IF) and spectral entropy (SE) moments using the time–frequency (TF) analysis. Three different forms of raw data were used as inputs, and we investigated the original PPG signal, the PPG signal with instantaneous frequency, and the PPG signal with spectral entropy. According to the results of the model testing, the PPG signal with spectral entropy generated the best outcomes. Compared to decision trees, subspace k-nearest neighbor, and k-nearest neighbor, our suggested approach with the super vector machine obtains a greater level of accuracy. The super vector machine, with 91.3% accuracy and a training duration of 9 s, was the best classifier. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151097187"

Measuring the absorbed light over time provides the photo-plethysmographic (PPG) waveform, which can represent the blood flow of a subject. One way of obtaining the PPG waveform is to use the camera and flash of a smartphone, placing them on the finger of a subject, and analyzing the variation of red color. The PPG can also be obtained using oximeter-like devices, which are non-invasive and safe. In contrast, to measure the blood glucose of a subject, a glucometer is used, which is a device that is typically invasive and expensive. Therefore, we propose the use of the following descriptors from Chaos theory to analyze the PPG signal: correlation dimension, maximum Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent. Then, these values are converted into a 3-dimensional vector that can be represented in a 3-dimensional space. Each vector has an associated glucose level that is used to train an algorithm which classifies all the vectors in three different ranges of blood glucose levels.  © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116195329"

Since the glycated hemoglobin value reflects the average blood glucose level over 3 months, it is not affected by exercise or food intake immediately prior to measurement. Thus, it is used as the most basic measure of evaluating blood‐glucose control over a certain period and predicting the occurrence of long‐term complications due to diabetes. However, as the existing measurement methods are invasive, there is a burden on the measurement subject who has to endure increased blood gathering and exposure to the risk of secondary infections. To overcome this problem, we propose a machine-learning‐based noninvasive estimation method in this study using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. First, the development of the device used to acquire the PPG signals is described in detail. Thereafter, discriminative and effective features are extracted from the acquired PPG signals using the device, and a machine‐learning algorithm is used to estimate the glycated hemoglobin value from the extracted features. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparison with existing model‐based methods. © 2022 by the authors.

The conventional finger‐prick method, though accurate, is not feasible for use multiple times a day, as it is painful and test strips are expensive. Although minimally invasive and noninvasive CGM systems have been introduced into the market, they are expensive and require finger‐prick calibrations. As the diabetes trend is high in low‐ and middle‐income countries, a cost‐effective and easy‐to‐use noninvasive glucose monitoring device is the need of the hour. This review paper briefly discusses the noninvasive glucose measuring technologies and their related research work. The technologies discussed are optical, transdermal, and enzymatic.

The spectrometer has been manufactured using a monolithically integrated filter process, enabling low-cost, low-power, miniature and mass-producible spectral sensors. Accurate biomarker models can be built using continuous on-skin hyperspectral tissue and PPG data. A deoxygenation trial on 17 healthy volunteers was conducted using the wrist-worn spectrometer in the 650-900nm wavelength range. Using partial least squares (PLS) modeling, a model was built to correlate the obtained spectral PPG data to SpO2 data from a reference finger clip (Nonin 8000A). In the tested range between 87% and 100% SpO2, an RMSEP of 1.86%SpO2 has been obtained on a separate test set, well within the 3.5% requirement of the FDA. For dermal skin hydration, a study on 29 volunteers (including 4 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and fluid retention in legs) was conducted with the spectrometer in the 750-1050 nm range. A spectroscopic model was compared with a lymph scanner as gold standard measuring localized percentage water content (PWC), yielding a decent prediction accuracy of 3.3% RMSE, while correctly identifying the patients with CHF. We demonstrated the viability of a miniaturized spectrometer for wearable skin biomarker measurements. This solution has the potential to detect other tissue biomarkers such as SpCO or StO2, or to read subdermal markers such as hydrogels for glucose or lactate detection.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Noninvasive in vivo blood‐glucose measurements help reduce the pain of piercing human fingertips to collect blood. To facilitate noninvasive meas-urements, this work proposes a Monte Carlo photon simulation‐based model to estimate blood-glucose concentration via photoplethysmography (PPG) on the fingertip. A heterogeneous finger model was exposed to light at 660 nm and 940 nm in the reflectance mode of PPG via Monte Carlo photon propagation. The bio‐optical properties of the finger model were also deduced to design the photon simulation model for the finger layers. The intensities of the detected photons after simulation with the model were used to estimate the blood‐glucose concentrations using a supervised ma-chine‐learning model, XGBoost. The XGBoost model was trained with synthetic data obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations and tested with both synthetic and real data (n = 35). For testing with synthetic data, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) of the model was found to be 0.91, and the coefficient of determination (R2) was found to be 0.83. On the other hand, for tests with real data, the Pearson’s r of the model was 0.85, and R2 was 0.68. Error grid analysis and Bland–Altman analysis were also performed to confirm the accuracy.

The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful, and uncomfortable for the patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine level based on PPG signal using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1 st and 2 nd) and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included to feature because of the significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and over-fitting. Finally, DNN based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R2 = 0:922 for Hb, R2 = 0:902 for Gl, and R2 = 0:969 for Cr. Experimental aftermaths show that the proposed method is a suitable technique to be used clinically to measure human blood component levels without taking blood samples. This paper also reveals that smartphone-based PPG signal has a great potential to measure the different blood components. © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100517300"

The CVDs are most likely caused by a delay in ignorance of early heart attack symptoms which are barely noticeable and patients receiving treatment. Those who attend regular checkups in their nearest medical care centers were advised to check their cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) risk factors like diabetes, tobacco smokers, etc. The use of electronic sensors in the healthcare environment in particular during diagnostics plays an important role in helping to detect potential CVDs. Conducting appropriate healthcare screening and monitoring can detect early symptoms that could be easily treatable. For example, a CVD such as heart disease can be attended to by following a healthy diet, physical exercise, taking the right drug medication, and avoiding substance (i.e. smoking tobacco, alcohol, etc). In this paper, an intelligent IoT based system which monitor's heartbeat was developed for remote patients. It exposes non-communicable CVDs symptoms by scanning human body in areas where photoelectric light can penetrate to detect a change in blood flow circulated by the heart. It uses the microcontroller, ESP32, to converts the analog photoelectric readings from a pulse sensor, MAX30102, into digital beats per minute (BPM), oxygen levels and a body temperature reading. The results showed a 90% accuracy with only few people showing a reading mismatch with a difference of 2-3%. Furthermore, it was noted that the system relied on the internet availability for the real-time reading to be transmitted to mobile application and online dashboard.

Despite extensive diagnostic workup, the etiology remains unknown in one out of three ischemic strokes (i.e., cryptogenic stroke). Prolonged cardiac monitoring can reveal asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in up to one-third of this population. This case report describes a cryptogenic stroke patient who received prolonged cardiac monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) as standard of care. In the context of a clinical study, the patient simultaneously monitored his heart rhythm with a PPG-based smartphone application. AF was detected simultaneously on both the ICM and smartphone application after three days of monitoring. Similar AF burden was detected during follow-up (five episodes, median duration of 28 and 34 h on ICM and mHealth, respectively, p = 0.5). The detection prompted the initiation of oral anticoagulation and AF catheter ablation procedure. Conclusion: This is the first report of the cryptogenic stroke patient in whom PPG-based mHealth was able to detect occurrence and burden of the symptomatic and asymptomatic paroxysmal AF episodes with similar precision as ICM. It accentuates the potential role of PPG-based mHealth in prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients.

Although, a few non-invasive methods have been proposed, they require high-end, costly, non-portable and custom devices. This paper proposes a non-invasive method to estimate average blood glucose using only smartphone that enables 24 × 7 monitoring without any extra hardware. The estimation is based on reflectance mode photoplethysmogram (PPG) that records the relative change in light absorbance of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) due to change in absorption coefficient and path length. Smartphone-based PPG gets often corrupted due to ambient noise, motion artefacts, etc. We rigorously cleaned the noisy PPG signal and measured reflected intensity from PPG of 25 patients, applied nonlinear regression to estimate glucose and cross-validated against a laboratory invasive method. The RMS error comes out to be 2.1525 mg/dL which is superior to existing non-invasive techniques. To prove the correctness, three standard techniques viz. geometric regression, Bland-Altman analyses and surveillance error grid are used.

Currently, blood glucose is monitored by a minimally invasive process where a small droplet of blood is extracted and passed to a glucometer—however, this process is uncomfortable for the patient. In this paper, a smartphone video-based noninvasive technique is proposed for the quantitative estimation of glucose levels in the blood. The videos are collected steadily from the tip of the subject’s finger using smartphone cameras and subsequently converted into a Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. A Gaussian filter is applied on top of the Asymmetric Least Square (ALS) method to remove high-frequency noise, optical noise, and motion interference from the raw PPG signal. These preprocessed signals are then used for extracting signal features such as systolic and diastolic peaks, the time differences between consecutive peaks (DelT), first derivative, and second derivative peaks. Finally, the features are fed into Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Square Regression (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models for the prediction of glucose level. Out of the four statistical learning techniques used, the PLS model, when applied to an unbiased dataset, has the lowest standard error of prediction (SEP) at 17.02 mg/dL. © 2021 by the authors.

Indeed, BGL indicators can help identify health risks associated with diabetes mellitus or provide efficient assistance and monitoring to patients diagnosed with diabetic conditions. However, the conventional methods of measuring blood glucose level require an invasive blood sampling technique to analyze the proportion of glucose in blood components. This method causes discomfort and relatively bulky equipment to remain available as portable systems. In this work, we proposed a system that uses long-term recurrent convolutional networks (LRCN) using non-invasive biomedical signal recording to estimate the blood glucose level. The proposed LRCN is combined with a robust feature extraction mechanism and can benefit from the temporal sensitivity of long short-term memory, to find a mathematical relationship between a photoplethysmogram (PPG) and blood glucose levels.

Recent studies have shown that people with type 2 diabetes have an increased mortality risk if they are hospitalized for pneumonia. Non-invasive wearable gadgets and the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) allow for more precise monitoring of blood glucose levels. Intensive care unit patients, expectant mothers, aged and bed-driven people have a constant battle to keep their blood glucose (BG) levels in check, including both hyper and hypoglycemia. Since internet-based healthcare systems heavily rely on technology to ensure adequate glucose control, the subject matters must be addressed cost-effectively.

Therefore, blood glucose level (BGL) is an essential health information for diagnosis and management of diabetes. Commonly, the BGL is usually measured invasively by taking blood samples, which can cause pain or discomfort to the patients. Our paper aims to design and develop a low-cost, low-computational non-invasive blood glucose measuring system using optical technique. The proposed system consists of a hardware for measuring photoplethysmogram (PPG). The PPG signal is subsequently analyzed to estimate the corresponding BGL, which is sent wirelessly to be stored in a database and displayed on an Android application. The application recommends the appropriate dosage of insulin injection based on the type of users and their diets. The report of historical blood glucose levels in the database can also be generated for further medical examination.Three PPG features, namely peak-to-peak amplitude, maximum amplitude, and standard deviation of signal amplitude, have the strongest correlations to the BGL. We investigate three regression models for estimating the BGL from these PPG parameters. The robustness of the system is assessed using cross validations. The average root mean squares error (RMSE) for three-fold cross-validations are 17.38, 16.76, and 16.39 mg/dL for simple linear regression, principal component regression, and partial least squares regression, respectively. The RMSEs from leave-one-out cross validation are approximately 12 mg/dL, with partial least squares regression model having the best accuracy. Furthermore, the results from Clarke Error Grid Analysis indicate that the system can be implemented with any of the three models for practical usage.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179556503"

Traditional blood glucose monitors are intrusive and give people pain and irritation. As a result, the study's goal was to find a non-invasive way to measure blood glucose. To determine blood glucose parameters, this system uses an NIR Spectroscopy-based system with a light source of wavelength 950nm. The light source illuminates the skin of the wrist, and a photodiode receiver captures the reflected beam. An Arduino UNO microcontroller receives the conditioned signal and digitalizes it. The spectrum is calculated by the Arduino board based on the subject's blood glucose levels. Pre-processing and segmenting the raw waveforms are required to obtain the peaks of the NIR spectrum and to compute the regression model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138279733"

If the glucose level in the blood remains very low or very high for long periods, it could cause serious diseases including tissue damage, stroke, heart disease, blindness and kidney failure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), currently there are around 450 million cases of diabetes in the world. With the increase in the number of diabetic patients, the demand for glucose measuring equipment has become increasingly urgent. As the currently popular invasive blood glucose measuring equipment will cause inconvenience and pain to patients and may even cause infections, it will inevitably bring psychological and physiological pressure to patients in the long term. Therefore, the realization of non-invasive blood glucose measurement has important clinical application value. Photoplethysmography(PPG) pulse wave contains abundant information about human cardiovascular physiology and pathology. This paper proposes a new method for non-invasive blood glucose detection based on spectral decomposition, aiming at the spectral information related to blood glucose concentration changes in the PPG signal that is difficult to observe in the time domain Continuous Wavelet Transform(CWT) is used to decompose the PPG signal from the corresponding scale and details in order to obtain the spectral component amplitude information related to the change of blood glucose concentration. Studies have found that there is a higher correlation between the change inthe amplitude of the PPG signal spectral components and the changes in the blood glucose concentration. Through the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), the detected blood glucose concentration and the obtained relevant PPG signal spectral components amplitude is modeled by partial least square regression, and the established model is evaluated. The Root Mean Square of Calibration (RMSEC) of the calibration set is 12.47 mg•dL-1, which is 0.69 mmol•L-1, and the Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of the prediction set is 6.21 mg•dL-1, which is 0.35 mmol•L-1. The agreement between the predicted value of model's blood glucose concentration and the reference value is 96.00%. The results of the OGTT experiments show that the spectral decomposition method can effectively separate the vibration characteristic absorption spectra of blood glucose molecular groups, and the blood glucose spectral component modeling can minimize the impact of physiological variability and various environmental conditions. The prediction results of the model meet the national testing standards (>95%). Clark grid error analysis show that the results predicted by this method can be used for daily blood glucose monitoring of patients. © 2021, Peking University Press.

Study design: The Biobeat Monitoring Platform includes a wearable wristwatch monitor that auto-matically samples cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), heart rate (HR) every 5 s and uploads all data to a smartphone-based app and to a data cloud, enabling remote patient monitoring and analysis of data. Low-risk parturients at term, carrying singletons pregnancies, were recruited at early delivery prior to the active phase. Big data analysis of the collected data was performed using the Power BI analysis tool (Microsoft). Next, data were normalized to visual presentation using Excel Data Analysis and the regression tool. Average measurements were compared before and after rupture of membranes, epidural anesthesia, fetal delivery, and placental expulsion. Results: Eighty-one parturients entered analysis. Epidural anesthesia was associated with a slight elevation in CO (5.5 vs. 5.6, L/min, 10 min before and after EA, p <0.05) attributed to a non-significant increase in both HR and SV. BP remained stable as of counter decrease in SVR (1361 vs. 1319 mmHg⋅min⋅mL−1, 10 min before and after EA, p <0.05). Fetal delivery was associated with a peak in CO after which it rapidly declined (6.0 vs. 7.2 vs. 6.1 L/min, 30 min before vs. point of delivery vs. after delivery, p <0.05). The mean BP remained stable throughout delivery with a slight increase at fetal delivery (92 vs. 95 vs. 92.1 mmHg, p <0.05), reflecting the increase in CO and decrease in SVR (1284 vs. 1112 vs. 1280 mmHg⋅min⋅mL−1,p <0.05)with delivery. Placental expulsion was associated with a second peak in CO and decrease in SVR.

In the recent years, more and more studies focus on the use of the non-invasive methods to achieve the blood glucose estimation. More and more consumer technology enterprises focusing on human health are committed to implementing accurate and noninvasive blood glucose algorithm in their products. The near infrared spectroscopy built in the wearable devices is one of the common approaches to achieve the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. However, due to the interference from the external environment, these wearable non-invasive methods yield the low estimation accuracy. Even if it is not medical equipment, as a consumer product, the detection accuracy will also be an important indicator for consumers. To address this issue, this paper employs different models based on different ranges of the blood glucose values for performing the blood glucose estimation. First the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are acquired and they are denoised via the bit plane singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Second, the features are extracted. For the data in the training set, first the features are averaged across the measurements in the feature domain via the optimization approach. Second, the random forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the training set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood glucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose values in the same group are employed to build an individual model. Fifth, for each feature, the average of the feature values for all the measurements in the same subset is computed. For the data in the test set, first, the sum of the weighted distances between the test feature values and the average values obtained in the above is computed for each model. Here, the weights are defined based on the importance sorted by the random forest obtained in the above. The model corresponding to the smallest sum is assigned. Finally, the blood glucose value is estimated based on the corresponding model. Compared to the state of arts methods, our proposed method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy. In particular, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and the percentage of the data fall in the zone A of the Clarke error grid yielded by our proposed method reaches 12.19%, and 87.0588%, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145431843"

The use of noninvasive technologies, such as wearable devices (WDs), to regulate and monitor BG in people with diabetes is a relatively new concept and yet in its infancy. Noninvasive WDs coupled with machine learning (ML) techniques have the potential to understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide clinically meaningful advanced analytics for the purpose of forecasting or prediction. Objective: The purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review complete with a quality assessment looking at diabetes effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) in WDs for forecasting or predicting BG levels. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction independently before cross-checking the extracted data. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Quality assessment was performed using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: From the initial 3872 studies, the features from 12 studies were reported after filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. The reference standard in all studies overall (n=11, 92%) was classified as low, as all ground truths were easily replicable. Since the data input to AI technology was highly standardized and there was no effect of flow or time frame on the final output, both factors were categorized in a low-risk group (n=11, 92%). It was observed that classical ML approaches were deployed by half of the studies, the most popular being ensemble-boosted trees (random forest). The most common evaluation metric used was Clarke grid error (n=7, 58%), followed by root mean square error (n=5, 42%). The wide usage of photoplethysmogram and near-infrared sensors was observed on wrist-worn devices. Conclusions: This review has provided the most extensive work to date summarizing WDs that use ML for diabetic-related BG level forecasting or prediction. Although current studies are few, this study suggests that the general quality of the studies was considered high, as revealed by the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. Further validation is needed for commercially available devices, but we envisage that WDs in general have the potential to remove the need for invasive devices completely for glucose monitoring in the not-too-distant future. © Arfan Ahmed, Sarah Aziz, Alaa Abd-alrazaq, Faisal Farooq, Mowafa Househ, Javaid Sheikh.

Upper extremity vascular disease (UEVD) and atherosclerosis are high-risk PADs for patients with Type 2 diabetes or with both diabetes and end-stage renal disease. For early UEVD detection, a fingertip-based, toe-based, or wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG) tool is a simple and noninvasive measurement system for vital sign monitoring and healthcare applications. Based on time-domain PPG analysis, a Duffing–Holmes system with a master system and a slave system is used to extract self-synchronization dynamic errors, which can track the differences in PPG morphology (in amplitudes (systolic peak) and time delay (systolic peak to diastolic peak)) between healthy subjects and PAD patients. In the preliminary analysis, the self-synchronization dynamic errors can be used to evaluate risk levels based on the reflection index (RI), which includes normal condition, lower PAD, and higher PAD. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is established as a multilayer classifier for automatic UEVD screening. The experimental results indicated that the self-synchronization dynamic errors have a positive correlation with the RI (R2 = 0.6694). The K-fold cross-validation is used to verify the performance of the proposed classifier with recall (%), precision (%), accuracy (%), and F1 score. © 2021 by the authors.

Managing it can be invasive and uncomfortable, often requiring blood samples or subdermal device implantation. The search of people with diabetes for a device that is easy to use, painless, requires less expense, and provides continuous monitoring has led researchers to find a way to measure glucose in a non-invasive way, which is why the project focuses on the development of a non-invasive glucometer using different infrared wavelengths. The system consists of implementing an optical sensor to detect photoplethysmography signals with a wavelength of 830nm, which is processed by an ESP32 microcontroller, determining the glucose absorbance to subsequently predict the glucose value in the patient's blood through equations set forth for different absorbance ranges. In addition, the results are shown on the system screen after 60 seconds of entering the finger. The tests were developed in 29 volunteers, and a blood sample was extracted for a laboratory test to determine glucose. Later, the system was analyzed under the ISO 15197 standard that allows quantifying the measurement precision of the glucose level using the Clarke error grid locating all the glucose values obtained in section A, which makes the system clinically acceptable.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179504759"

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique which uses infrared light to determine the fluctuations in blood stream in the human body with every pulse. However literature reveals that, a functional correlation exists among pulse signal waveform and the glucose contents in the blood. Many researchers have shown estimation of glucose using different spectroscopy techniques which involves an optical sensor. The key involvement of this paper is withdrawal of different features with respect to time domain as well as frequency domain. Exploration of single pulse is also carried out with different features. A PPG data of 182 random people with varied health conditions like diabetic, blood pressure condition is recorded for about 1 min duration. The glucose estimation is done in two ways: the first one is feature extraction from complete PPG signal of a patient and the second one is single pulse wave analysis. All the features from above-mentioned methods are transformed into feature vector which acts as input to system and estimation of blood glucose is performed. We used Clarke Error Grid Analysis for blood glucose estimation which is clinically accepted. With time and frequency domain features we got 43.75% samples in region A and 50% samples in region B, so total 93.75% samples are in regions A and B. Using single pulse wave analysis we got 59.66% samples in region A and 34.61% samples in region B, so total 94.27% samples are in clinically accepted regions (A and B). As single pulse wave analysis shows significant improvement in region A (20% of actual blood glucose value), this method is good selection for glucose measurement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151046425"

PPG technology is widely used in a variety of wearable sensors to investigate the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of PPG analysis for carrying out large-scale screening to prevent and detect diabetes. However, most of these studies require feature extraction and/or several pre-processing steps. Over the past few years, the advent of deep learning has significantly impacted the analysis of biomedical signals. Despite their success in other fields, however, very few studies have focused on the application of deep learning to raw PPG signals for detecting diabetes. Existing studies have proposed large models trained on large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a Light CNN-based model for screening the presence of type 2 diabetes using a single raw pulse extracted from photoplethysmographic signals. In addition to the baseline architecture, we evaluate different model architectures that take as input age and biological sex or PPG handcrafted features. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to all the tested architectures to evaluate the effectiveness of harnessing pre-trained models in detecting diabetes. We tested a model pre-trained on a general PPG shape dataset and another model pre-trained on a dataset containing hypertension PPG signals. Our model scored an AUC of 75.5 when trained with raw PPG waves, age, and biological sex without applying transfer learning, which is competitive with current state of the art.  © 2023 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159804737"

This paper presents a high precision near-infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) based noninvasive glucose monitoring System on Chip (SoC). The proposed system implements a fully differential Analog Frontend (AFE) with nonlinear medium Gaussian support-vector-regression (NMG-SVR) for glucose estimation. The AFE design incorporates chopping which enables the reduction of the integrated input-referred current noise to 9.4pArms thus achieving a dynamic range of 115dB. The glucose prediction processor (GPP) removes noise from the PPG signal, extracts ten unique features, and estimates the blood glucose level using a trained customized NMG-SVR model that minimizes the hardware cost by 25%. The extracted features are carefully designed and implemented to ensure inter-feature dependency, which helps to reduce the overall area by more than 40%. Moreover, GPP is implemented using power and clock gating techniques to minimize both static and dynamic power consumption. The proposed SoC is realized with 0.18μ m CMOS technology and occupies an area of 6 mm2. It dissipates a power of 186μ W and achieves a mean absolute relative difference (mARD) of 6.9% verified on 200 subjects.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132719942"

In this study we explored the utility of post-prandial vascular stiffness as a surrogate measure for estimating insulin resistance, which is a pre-diabetic condition. Approach. A cohort of 51 healthy young adults with varying body mass index (BMI) values was studied using fasting plasma values of insulin and glucose, fasting and post-meal finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance 2 (HOMA-IR2) using fasting plasma insulin and glucose. Vascular stiffness was estimated by reciprocal of pulse arrival time (rPAT) from ECG and finger PPG at five time points from fasting to 2 h post-oral glucose ingestion. We examined if insulin resistance correlates with meal-induced vascular stiffness changes, supporting the feasibility of using finger PPG to estimate insulin resistance. Main results. HOMA-IR2 was positively correlated with an early rise (0 to 30 min post-meal) and delayed fall (30 to 120 min post-meal) of rPAT. Correlation persisted even after the effect of BMI has been partialled out in subgroup analysis. We conclude that finger PPG-based pulse waveform and single-lead ECG has the potential to be used as a non-invasive method for the assessment of insulin resistance. Significance. As both signals, namely ECG and PPG, can be easily acquired using wearable and other low-cost sensing systems, the present study can serve as a pointer to develop accessible strategies for monitoring and longitudinal tracking of insulin resistance in health and pathophysiological states.  © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133214300"

Photoplethysmography (PPG) can realize non-invasive and continuous monitoring of pulse wave signal, but it is susceptible to interference from human EMG signal, power frequency interference, baseline drift and other noises, resulting in inaccurate signals. Wavelet transform and principal component analysis (PCA) are used to get rid of baseline drift and high frequency noise in pulse wave signals, thereby reducing noise interference. It is possible to obtain an accurate pulse wave signal by preprocessing the actual data that the sensor has collected. The findings indicate that the algorithm can effectively remove noise, preserve the main details of the signal, increase the signal-to-noise ratio, provide effective data support for more accurate estimation of human physiological parameters including heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as well as enable the combination of medical signal monitoring and smart wearable devices. © Textile Bioengineering and Informatics Symposium Proceedings 2022 - 15th Textile Bioengineering and Informatics Symposium, TBIS 2022.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141359436"

Due to the noncontinuous nature of the monitoring, the BP values of the patient remain unavailable between consecutive cuff measurements, carrying the risk of missing rapid and sudden variations in BP. We evaluated the added value of using a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based continuous BP measurement device in addition to the standard cuff-based monitoring in a cohort of 40 patients in comparison with the current approach, in which only intermittent cuff-based measurements are available. When using a three-minute cuff measurement interval, using the PPG-based BP measurement in addition to the cuff-based monitor reduced the error (mean ± SD) of systolic (SBP) and mean (MBP) BP from 2.6 ± 19.6 mmHg and 1.2 ± 13.2 mmHg to 0.5 ± 11.2 mmHg and 0.0 ± 8.1 mmHg, respectively. Error grid analysis was also used to assess the improvement in patient safety. The additional use of the PPG-based BP measurement reduced the amount of data falling into higher risk categories. For SBP, points falling in the significant-, moderate-, and low-risk categories decreased from 1.1%, 8.7%, and 19.3% to 0.0%, 2.3%, and 9.6%, respectively. Similar results were obtained for MBP. These results suggest that using a PPG-based BP monitor—in addition to the standard cuff-based monitor—can improve patient safety during anesthesia induction, with no additional sensor needed. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140578318"

This device operates on the principle of light absorption, known as the Beer-Lambert Law, tracking changes in near-infrared light absorbance of blood glucose with blood volume changes in a photoplethysmogram (PPG) using opto-electronics. The design incorporates near-infrared 950 nm wavelength and red 630 nm wavelength LED light sources and a photodiode light receiver. An Arduino NANO 3.0 Mini USB microcontroller was used for signal processing, enabling the meter to compute blood glucose levels in the range of 70 to 130 mg/dL and measure heart rate across the range of 60 to 100 bpm. To validate the effectiveness of this device, it was used by a sample group of diabetic patients at the Endocrine Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Vajira Hospital. The results of device evaluation compared with standard clinical measurements were as follows: 1) The non-invasive blood glucose meter accurately measured blood sugar levels in the range of 75 to 150 mg/dL (R2 = 0.99); 2) Across the ranges of 75 to 130 mg/dL and 131 to 289 mg/dL the device had average percentage error of 3.18% and 22.14%, respectively and the overall average percentage error was 10.76%; 3) Heart rate measurements from 60 to 100 bpm showed a mean percentage error of 2.94%, and these were not statistically different from a vital sign monitor (p= 0.222), and 4) Although readings from the meter appeared to be systematically lower than results of standard blood tests, this was not a statistically significant difference (p= 0.135). Overall, these findings indicate that this non-invasive blood glucose meter may be suitable for non-critical patient monitoring applications where patient comfort and convenience are important considerations. © 2022, Rangsit University.

Traditionally, analyzing patients with diabetes has remained a largely invasive approach. Wearable devices (WDs) make use of sensors historically reserved for hospital settings. WDs coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to help understand and conclude meaningful information from the gathered data and provide advanced and clinically meaningful analytics. Objective: This review aimed to provide an overview of AI-driven WD features for diabetes and their use in monitoring diabetes-related parameters. Methods: We searched 7 of the most popular bibliographic databases using 3 groups of search terms related to diabetes, WDs, and AI. A 2-stage process was followed for study selection: reading abstracts and titles followed by full-text screening. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the data. Results: From an initial 3872 studies, we report the features from 37 studies post filtering according to our predefined inclusion criteria. Most of the studies targeted type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or both (21/37, 57%). Many studies (15/37, 41%) reported blood glucose as their main measurement. More than half of the studies (21/37, 57%) had the aim of estimation and prediction of glucose or glucose level monitoring. Over half of the reviewed studies looked at wrist-worn devices. Only 41% of the study devices were commercially available. We observed the use of multiple sensors with photoplethysmography sensors being most prevalent in 32% (12/37) of studies. Studies reported and compared >1 machine learning (ML) model with high levels of accuracy. Support vector machine was the most reported (13/37, 35%), followed by random forest (12/37, 32%). Conclusions: This review is the most extensive work, to date, summarizing WDs that use ML for people with diabetes, and provides research direction to those wanting to further contribute to this emerging field. Given the advancements in WD technologies replacing the need for invasive hospital setting devices, we see great advancement potential in this domain. Further work is needed to validate the ML approaches on clinical data from WDs and provide meaningful analytics that could serve as data gathering, monitoring, prediction, classification, and recommendation devices in the context of diabetes. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This study investigated the correlation between cardiopulmonary endurance indices and plasma glucose levels and abdominal visceral fat in males with new-onset type 2 diabetes. Methods: A total of 136 male individuals, who had been treated in the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao City, were selected to form a new-onset type 2 diabetes group (66 cases) and a control group (70 cases); individuals were divided into three groups (Q1, Q2, and Q3) from low to high according to their anaerobic threshold (AT) oxygen uptake (VO2), AT VO2/kg (VO2 per kg of body weight), peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT heart rate (HR), peak HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. A cardiopulmonary exercise test was used to determine the VO2 of each group of subjects for VO2 max and AT VO2/kg, HR, and HR recovery after 1 minute. The differences in fat areas and plasma glucose levels were compared under different cardiorespiratory endurance indicators. Results: Compared with the control group, the abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels increased in the new-onset type 2 diabetes group. Concurrently, AT VO2, AT VO2/kg, peak VO2, peak VO2/kg, AT HR, peak HR, and 1-minute HR recovery all decreased, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P<0.05). The higher the AT VO2 and peak VO2 values, the lower the PPG level (P<0.05) and the smaller the area of abdominal visceral fat (P<0.05). The AT VO2/kg and peak VO2/kg values were negatively correlated with the abdominal visceral fat area, while other indicators had no obvious relationship with either plasma glucose levels or the area of fat. Conclusion: The levels of blood glucose and visceral fat are correlated with cardiopulmonary function. With the increase in blood glucose levels and visceral fat, the indices of cardiopulmonary function gradually decrease. The correlation between different cardiopulmonary function indices and blood glucose levels and visceral fat was different. © 2022 Liu et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130122208"

The most remarkable feature of the PPG method is the modulation of the light at the heartbeat frequency after being returned from a biological tissue in-vivo. However, the physiological model of light interaction with pulsatile blood vessels remains a subject of continuing debate. In this chapter, we review various mechanisms responsible for the generation of PPG waveforms. Particular attention is paid to the model recently proposed in our group, which claims that the heart-related light modulation arises from mechanical compression—decompression of the intercapillary tissue due to changes in the transmural arterial pressure. To support this new model, we refer to several recently published experimental observations. The method of imaging PPG allows noninvasive assessment of microvasculature blood flow on the vast surface of the skin and internal organs, both at rest and under various functional tests. An in-depth understanding of the physiological origin of PPG waveforms may enable quantitative characterization of the mechanisms of systemic vascular regulation and solution of the most important problem—the assessment of neurogenic vasomotor reactivity, the value of which is no less important than the neurogenic regulation of heart rhythm to maintain systemic hemodynamic parameters. Based on profound understanding of the physiological mechanism behind PPG, new methods for early diagnosis of socially important diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, systemic sclerosis, skin, stomach, and intestines cancer among others, can be developed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In view of this problem, this article will develop a glucose meter system that does not require introducing a needle into the patient's finger since it will use the photoplestimographic signal generated by the oximetry sensor and can be monitored, so that the system performs the measurement without pain and shows the value of the glucose level accurately, being of immense help to diabetic patients who need to control their glucose several times a day. Through the development of the system, it was observed that the system works in the best way, when comparing the glucose level measurement with other conventional glucometer equipment, a relative error of 4.786% was obtained, being an accepted error because it is close to the real value of the glucose level in the blood. © 2022 International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering.

Type 2 diabetes is associated with the involvement of both small vessels and large vessels. Studies on the relevance of baPWV to early diabetic nephropathy are scarce. This retrospective observational case-control study enrolled 120 patients with type 2 diabetes from our medical records. We classified patients into two groups depending on the magnitude of albuminuria: 60 patients with microalbuminuria were classified as the early diabetic nephropathy group (EDN group) and 60 patients without albuminuria were classified as the diabetes without nephropathy group (DWN group). An additional 30 nondiabetic age-and sex-matched controls were also enrolled. Data regarding the lipid profile, blood pressure, baPWV, high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level, anthropometric measurements, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), serum creatinine level, and glycemic control indices (i.e., fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c)) were recorded for all enrolled participants. baPWV was significantly higher in the EDN group than in the DWN group. Moreover, baPWV was positively correlated with age, duration of diabetes, obesity, poor glycemic control, and high serum levels of triglycerides (TG), hs-CRP, creatinine, and uric acid as well as a high UACR (all P<0.01). A significant negative correlation was found between baPWV and high-density lipoprotein levels (P<0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the hs-CRP level and duration of diabetes most strongly influenced baPWV. baPWV may be a convenient, noninvasive, and reproducible method for detecting early diabetic nephropathy. © 2021 Xueyang Zhang et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101659605"

Integrated in smartwatches, health patches and finger clips, PPG sensors are widely used in fitness, glucose, blood pressure, and medical monitoring with good user comfort. Integrating PPG in medical chest patches is interesting for COVID-19 patients since it can yield, next to HR and respiration, also SpO2, which traditional ECG-based patches cannot provide. However, measuring PPG/SpO 2 on the chest is challenging due to large motion artifacts, small AC/DC perfusion index (PI \lt 0.1%), and ambient light. Therefore, it poses a more stringent requirement on dynamic range (DR \gt 120 dB) for the PPG readout circuit, while still requiring low power consumption for long battery life. On-chip pinned-photodiodes (PPDs) have been used as passive integrators, resulting in very low power consumption (2.63 \mu \mathrm{W}) for the PPG readout [1]. However, the DR and linearity can be limited by the PPDs' parasitic capacitors. Direct light-todigital converter (LDC) topologies are proposed in [2 - 4], but their DR is still below 120dB. In [5], a digital-controlled TIA is exploited to control the transimpedance gain, which extends the DR to 130dB while consuming 72 \mu \mathrm{W} in the analog front-end (AFE). © 2021 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102354140"

Wearable devices and non-invasive sensors for blood glucose monitoring have witnessed considerable advances. This review is an update on recent contributions utilizing novel sensing technologies over the past five years which include electrocardiogram, electromagnetic, bioimpedance, photoplethysmography, and acceleration measures as well as bodily fluid glucose sensors to monitor glucose and trend detection.

It is a preferential target for critical comorbidities (overweight, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease). Movement and activity are consistently regarded as beneficial, but the related adaptive physiology is still poorly understood. Our goal was to better identify the foot microcirculatory changes after a regular walking gait activity in healthy subjects of different ages. Methods: Twelve healthy participants of both sexes, with normal BMI and Ankle-Brachial Index, were selected and grouped according to age - group I (21.0 ± 1 y.o.) and group II (55.8 ± 3 y.o.). The protocol involved 2 phases of 5-min duration each - phase 1, a static standing position, and phase 2, 5-min walking with a comfortable pace on a pre-established circuit. Perfusion changes were assessed in the dorsal region of both feet before (baseline, phase 1) and after (phase 2) the gait period by noninvasive optical technologies - laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), photoplethysmography, and polarized spectroscopy (PSp). Comparative statistics were performed with a 95% confidence level. Results: All instruments detected an asymmetric nonsignificant perfusion between right and left feet during rest in all participants with values in females consistently lower than men. Older participants exhibited lower baseline values than the younger group. Gait evoked a perfusion reduction in all participants relative to phase 1 detected with all technologies, with statistically significant changes recorded with LDF (group I, p = 0.033, and group II, p = 0.028) and PSp (group II, p = 0.041). Furthermore, LDF revealed that gait significantly reduced perfusion velocity in the older group (p = 0.003). Corresponding changes in the younger group were present but discrete. Recovery to baseline levels was also slower in the older group. Discussion/Conclusions: Our results confirm that perfusion is age dependent and demonstrate the clinical relevance of simple dynamic activities such as gait. This reduction of the dorsal foot perfusion occurs in depth, being more pronounced with the movement intensity, suggesting a wide application potential in early diagnostics as for rehabilitation.  © 2022 S.

This type of invasive measurement is very painful and uncomfortable for the patient who is required to measure hemoglobin or glucose regularly. However, the non-invasive method only needed a bio-signal (image or spectra) to estimate blood components with the advantages of being painless, cheap, and user-friendliness. In this work, a non-invasive hemoglobin and glucose level estimation model have been developed based on multigene genetic programming (MGGP) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) characteristic features extracted from fingertip video captured by a smartphone. The videos are processed to generate the PPG signal. Analyzing the PPG signal, its first and second derivative, and applying Fourier analysis total of 46 features have been extracted. Additionally, age and gender are also included in the feature set. Then, a correlation-based feature selection method using a genetic algorithm is applied to select the best features. Finally, an MGGP based symbolic regression model has been developed to estimate hemoglobin and glucose level. To compare the performance of the MGGP model, several classical regression models are also developed using the same input condition as the MGGP model. A comparison between MGGP based model and classical regression models have been done by estimating different error measurement indexes. Among these regression models, the best results (±0.304 for hemoglobin and ±0.324 for glucose) are found using selected features and symbolic regression based on MGGP. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101812507"

However, using blood glucose (BG) meters presents a risk of infection. It is of great importance to develop non-invasive BG detection techniques. To realize high-accuracy, low-cost and continuous glucose monitoring, we have developed a non-invasive BG detection system using a mixed signal processor 430 (MSP430) microcontroller. This method is based on the combination of the conservation-of-energy method with a sensor integration module, which collects physiological parameters, such as the blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), blood flow velocity and heart rate. New methods to detect the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and BV are proposed, which combine the human body heat balance and characteristic signals of photoplethysmography as well dual elastic chambers theory. Four hundred clinical trials on real-time non-invasive BG monitoring under suitable experiment conditions were performed on different individuals, including diabetic patients, senior citizens and healthy adults. A multisensory information fusion model was applied to process these samples. The algorithm (we defined it as DCBPN algorithm) applied in the model combines a decision tree and back propagation neural network, which classifies the physiological and environmental parameters into three categories, and then establishes a corresponding prediction model for the three categories. The DCBPN algorithm provides an accuracy of 88.53% in predicting the BG of new samples. Thus, this system demonstrates a great potential to reliably detect BG values in a non-invasive setting. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012903649"

Methods: Vasodilatory responses (EA and relative distensibility [RD]) were evaluated noninvasively using iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACH) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and recorded by laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) and photoplethysmography (PPG) among 324 patients. Results: The EA after ACH iontophoresis measured by LDF was significantly higher in the younger (<50 years) group than in the older (>50 years) group, 125.4 versus 103.3 integrated arbitrary unit (P < .005). Compared to the older patients, the EA values recorded by LDF were significantly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus (64.9), hypercholesterolemia (83.3), hypertension (88.7), CAD (61.0), and peripheral artery disease (67.4).

Those devices are very similar in their analog front end circuit which is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). Many different TIA topologies have appeared in different optoelectronic fields which make the choice of the best TIA topology for a certain application a challenging task. In this regard, this paper presents a comparison between state of the art, previously published TIA topologies. All topologies are simulated at four different simulation cases to account for various design scenarios. The topologies are simulated with 10 pF photodiode (PD) input capacitance and 5 KHz bandwidth (BW) while optimizing for two different targets; one time for minimum input noise and the other for minimum power consumption. Moreover, the same procedures are performed with 2 pF PD and 100 MHz BW to account for higher BW demanding applications. The studied topologies are compared according to their transimpedance gain, power consumption, total input referred noise current, and dynamic range (DR) to expose their relative merits. A noise and a transimpedance gain mathematical models are also presented for each topology to assist the comparison. Recommendations to designers on which TIA to select in a certain application are concluded according to the obtained results. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079826040"

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is one of the early complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, resulting in autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of ANS function indicators to screen for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as measured by the TM-Oxi and SudoPath system. Methods: All enrolled participants completed a basic sociodemographic and medical history questionnaire including current medications. Healthy controls (n = 25) underwent a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to evaluate glucose, insulin, and insulin C-peptide. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 24) were assessed with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin. The TM-Oxi and SudoPath system evaluation was completed by all subjects. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22. Frequency and descriptive statistics were calculated on all variables. The criterion for statistical significance was a = 0.05. Results: The twenty-five healthy controls had a mean age of 37.0 years. The twenty-four type 2 diabetes mellitus patients currently undergoing standard treatment had a mean age of 48.9 years. Based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines, we detected pre-diabetes in 4 subjects and diabetes in 1 subject, while all other subjects had normal FPG values. At 120 minutes, the correlations between the OGTT and cardiometabolic risk score (CMRS) were: r = 0.56 (p = 0.004) for glucose and r = 0.53 (p = 0.006) for insulin. At 120 minutes, the correlations between the OGTT and photoplethysmography index (PTGi) were: r = -0.56 (p = 0.003) for glucose and r = -0.41 (p = 0.04) for insulin. The CMRS, PTGi, and plethysmography total power index (PTGVLFi) differed significantly between the diabetes patients and healthy participants. The specificity and sensitivity for the CMRS, PTGi, and PTVLFi comparing the diabetes patients with healthy controls were high. Conclusion: The TM-Oxi and SudoPath system shows promise as a valid, convenient, and non-invasive screening method for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The ANS function and CMR indicators measured by this system may be useful in guiding diabetes and cardiovascular health screening, treatment, and monitoring. © 2014 Lewis et al.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922976475"

Therefore, the study was aimed to measure blood glucose non-invasively based on a machine learning technique.

The detected signal is conditioned, digitalized and passed to the Arduino UNO microcontroller. The Arduino board derives the PPG signal in accordance with the subject blood glucose values. The raw waveform is pre-processed and subsequently segmented for obtaining the peak of the PPG signal. The random forest machine learning technique is implemented on the acquired segmented signal, to obtain various statistical features namely mean, variance, skewness, entropy, kurtosis and standard deviation.

Medical devices of this kind give the firsthand information about the health condition of the patient and also suggests patient if any necessary actions need to be taken based on the observed symptoms. Although several attempts have been made to develop wearable non-invasive medical devices, still there is a huge demand to catch the need of resources constrained population. This paper suggests the design of a wearable patch sensor based on Photo Plethysmography (PPG) unit which can be used as a patch sensor or a wearable device for measuring the heart rate of the patient. The device consists of a sensor developed by Maxim Integrated Circuit for acquiring the PPG signal. The heart rate obtained from the PPG device is communicated serially to Arduino Processor using I2C serial communication, also accelerometer is embedded with the system for detecting undesirable hand movement while measuring heart rate from the signal derived from the PPG device. The Arduino Processor is also connected with the blue tooth model for further communication. The sensor can be placed either in cloth or in thin rubber sheet such that total unit can be tied around the wrist or can be designed place in any other part of the body were PPG signal can be recorded. From the preliminary pilot study, it can be concluded that the proposed patch sensor based PPG yields promising results for the measurement of heart rate. The device needs to be validated with large sample size before introducing to the clinical trial. © 2016 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034272899"

The method, which could be easily applied to humans, is based on principal dynamic mode (PDM) analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Unlike the power spectral density, PDM has been shown to be able to separately identify the activities of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems without pharmacological intervention. Method: HRV parameters were measured by processing PPG signals from conscious 1.5- to 5-month-old C57/BL6 control mice and in Akita mice, a model of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, and compared with the gold-standard Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Results: The PDM results indicate significant cardiac autonomic impairment in the diabetic mice in comparison to the controls. When tail-cuff PPG recordings were collected and analyzed starting from 1.5 months of age in both C57/Bl6 controls and Akita mice, onset of DCAN was seen at 3 months in the Akita mice, which persisted up to the termination of the recording at 5 months. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses also showed a reduction in nerve density in Akita mice at 3 and 4 months as compared to the control mice, thus, corroborating our PDM data analysis of HRV records. Conclusions: Western blot analysis of autonomic nerve proteins corroborated the PPG-based HRV analysis via the PDM approach.

The challenges become greater when early detection found to be the best treatment method. Currently, guidelines for the early detection and treatment of occult AF are limited. Electrophysiology study is most reliable noninvasive screening method used in AF detection. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the present electrophysiological measurement in clinical practice. In this study, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) based physiological measurement is introduced through heart rate variability and cardiac cycle fitness as the potential AF screening index. Seven subjects, one normal and six clinically confirmed AF patient's PPG were recorded. All patient's blood profile (INR and blood glucose) and blood pressure measurement were retrieved from pass clinical record. Infographic and data visualization technique were adopted in presenting the AF presence in PPG signal. This preliminary result has provided a foundation for AF detection by using PPG waveforms.

Traditionally invasive techniques are used to estimate the concentration of blood glucose. Many efforts have been made to reduce the level of invasiveness of the glucose monitoring by decreasing the blood sample volume. The challenge for non invasive assays is to develop transducers with high sensitivity, capable of detecting weak blood signals that loose energy through intervening tissues (bone, fat, skin etc), and also to separate glucose information from other overlapping blood constituents with much higher concentration (water, haemoglobin, uric acid, urea, proteins). Many biomedical spectroscopy studies have been carried out in the mid infra-red region of the spectrum where the absorbance is high but the cost of the equipment becomes prohibitively high because of the high cost of LED. This chapter deals with the spectroscopic techniques carried out in near infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum to estimate the concentration of blood glucose. The spectroscopy has been performed at the second overtone of glucose which falls in the NIR region. The NIR spectroscopy has been performed based on NIR LED and photo detector constituting an optode pair, using transmission photoplethsymography (PPG). The analog front end system has been implemented to get the PPG signal at the near infra-red wavelengths of 1070nm, 950nm, 935nm. The PPG signal that has been obtained is processed and double regression analysis has been carried out with the artificial neural network for estimating the glucose levels. The root mean square error of the prediction was 5.84mg/dL. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021338967"

Previous studies have shown better estimation of blood glucose level using an optical sensor. An optical sensor based data acquisition system is built and the PPG signal of the subjects is recorded. The main contribution of this paper is exploring various features of a PPG signal using Single Pulse Analysis technique for effective estimation of BGL values. A PPG data of 611 individuals is recorded over duration of 3 minutes each. BGL value estimation is performed using two types of feature sets, (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA). Neural network is trained using above mentioned proposed feature sets and BGL value estimation is performed. First we validate our methodology using the same features used by Monte Moreno in his earlier work. The experimentation is performed on our own dataset. We obtained comparable results of BGL value estimation as compared with Monte Moreno, with maximum R2 = 0.81. Further, BGL estimation using (i) Time and frequency domain features and (ii) Single Pulse Analysis (SPA) is performed and the resulting coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) obtained for reference vs. prediction are 0.84 and 0.91, respectively. Clarke Error Grid analysis for BGL estimation is clinically accepted, so we performed similar analysis. Using Time and frequency domain feature set, the distributions of data samples is obtained as 80.6% in class A and 17.4% in class B. 1% samples in zone C and Zone D. For Single Pulse Analysis technique (SPA) the distribution of data samples are 83% in class A and 17% in class B. The proposed features in SPA have shown significant improvement in R2 and Clarke Error grid analysis. SPA technique with the proposed feature set is a good choice for the implementation of system for measurement of non-invasive glucometer. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065426439"

The risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, sedentary lifestyle and smoking. Many parameters had been produced to monitor cardiovascular disease risk. Finger photoplethysmography (PPG) is a simple, low-cost and non-invasive optical method that detects blood volume change in the microvascular bed of the finger. PPG fitness index (PPGF), vascular risk prediction index (VRPI) and estimated vascular age were derived from PPG wave and proposed for assessment of cardiovascular risk. PPGF was produced from AC component of PPG morphological changes against a healthy 19-year-old reference identified from Malaysia population. AC is component of PPG records physiological properties of the arteries. Heart rate (HR) is a known factor that influences vascular function and this factor may affect the PPG parameters. It is important to determine the effect of HR variation on PPGF and to confirm PPGF stability across variable HR so that it will be a valid marker for cardiovascular disease risk. This study aims to develop and validate heart rate-incorporated PPGF algorithm for cardiovascular disease risk assessment.

HbAIc, which is the integrated effect of FPG, and PPG, represents the chronic sustained hyperglycaemia and is the long-term glycaemic measure of diabetes control and patient’s risk for its complications. Glycaemic variability represents acute glycaemic fluctuations and is associated with activation of oxidative stress with resultant overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain. Self-monitoring of blood glucose with an optimal frequency of 3 - 7 per day is the cornerstone of diabetes management and is associated with significantly improved glycaemic control and decreased all cause and diabetes-related mortality in insulin treated diabetics. SMBG and HbA1C supplemented with RT-CGM have been shown to improve glycaemic control and glycaemic excursions. Use of continous glucose monitoring systems which provide a more complete view of the glycaemic excursions, has been validated in T1DM but not in T2DM. The use of RT-CGM as sole glycaemic measure; however, is not recommended in the ICU and the operating room settings because of uncoupling of relationship between plasma glucose and ISF due to altered haemodynamics and interference from the use of vasopressors and other medications in such settings. 1, 5-anhydroglucitol, fructosamine and glycated albumin are useful short-term measures of glycaemic control over the preceding 2 - 3 weeks in conditions like haemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, haemolytic anaemias, CKD, etc., which affect the glycation of intracellularly located haemoglobin. 1,5 anhydrogluctitol is a useful marker of post-prandial glycaemic fluctuations in patients with HbA1C at or near target. Role of glycaemic variability in the onset and progression of diabetic complications, and that of 1, 5 anhydrogluctotol in non-Japanese ethnic groups and in condition with severe hyperglycaemia (HbA1C > 10%) needs to be evaluated in well-designed clinical trials. The concern raised by FDA regarding accuracy of SMBG devices using glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase, for measuring glucose need to addressed. Though GV is perceived as newer component of dysglycaemic risk yet its role in assessing the patient’s risk for complications needs further validation before its routine clinical use as an additional or alternative glycaemic measures can be considered.

The goal of the study is to develop a device that can monitor the blood glucose level that would not cause any discomfort to the patients by utilizing reflectance mode photoplethysmography equipped with a filtering technique, Moving Average filter. Initially, the device prompts the user to choose from two categories depending on his condition: diabetic or non-diabetic, and then would choose between the two modes: fasting or post meal mode. The parameters utilized in the study are the force in Newton (N) which corresponds to the applied pressure on the finger, the peak-to-peak voltage (V) of the photopletyhsmography signal, and lastly, the blood glucose level measured in milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). The force is acquired using a force sensitive resistor that is incorporated in the ring. The suggested device employs a photoplethysmography sensor which can diagnose variations on microvascular bed of tissue. The variations in the distribution of blood volume have a significant relation with the measurement of blood glucose level.

PPG monitoring is widely used in the healthcare as this single pulse study can provide wide physiological information non-invasively such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure (continuous and cuff less), blood volume, arterial stiffness and respiration rate. First and second derivatives of PPG provide important information about the arterial stiffness and vascular health of the person. Aim: This paper explains the design and development of prototype with RED LED (660 nm) and IR LED (860 nm) as a source and OPT 101 as a detector. Second derivative related indices of PPG (for RED LED and IR LED) were calculated. Materials and methods: Study was carried out on 15 healthy female subjects without any known history of blood pressure and blood glucose; aged between 19-23 years. Results and conclusion: Amplitude of PPG obtained from RED LED is smaller than the amplitude of PPG obtained from IR LED. Comparative analysis of first and second derivative of the PPG obtained from RED light source and IR light source is discussed by the authors. It was observed that various parameters studied from second derivative are the ‘Normalized Values’, so effect of change in the amplitude of the PPG signal obtained from RED LED and IR LED get nullified in this study (P>0.05).

Owing to its nature, it is typically asymptomatic until later in its progression when the vessel or organ structure has already been compromised. Therefore, noninvasive and continuous BP measurement methods are needed to ensure appropriate diagnosis and early management before hypertension leads to irreversible complications. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technology with waveform morphologies similar to that of arterial BP waveforms, therefore attracting interest regarding its usability in BP estimation. In recent years, wearable devices incorporating PPG sensors have been proposed to improve the early diagnosis and management of hypertension. Additionally, the need for improved accuracy and convenience has led to the development of devices that incorporate multiple different biosignals with PPG. Through the addition of modalities such as an electrocardiogram, a final measure of the pulse wave velocity is derived, which has been proved to be inversely correlated to BP and to yield accurate estimations. This paper reviews and summarizes recent studies within the period 2010-2019 that combined PPG with other biosignals and offers perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of current developments to guide future advancements in BP measurement.

With the improvement of the measurement accuracy of the acquisition devices developed in recent decades, developing the optical-based methods for performing the non-invasive blood glucose estimation for the consumer applications becomes very important. The authors' previous work is based on the heart rate variability of the electrocardiogram and the existing method is based on applying the random forest to the features extracted from the photoplethysmogram. However, the accuracies of these two methods are not very high. In this study, a joint empirical mode decomposition and exponential function estimation approach is proposed for estimating the mean value of a photoplethysmogram acquired from a wearable noninvasive blood glucose device. Also, the exponential function fitting approach is employed for estimating the blood glucose levels via an L1norm formulation. The computer numerical simulation results show that the estimation accuracy based on their proposed method is higher than that based on the state-of-the-art methods.

It is a multifactorial disease, caused by genetic factors and lifestyle habits. Brazil had ∼ 16.8 million individuals living with diabetes in 2019 and is expected to reach 26 million people by 2045. There are global increasing needs for the development of noninvasive diagnostic methods and use of mobile health, mainly in face of the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For daily glycemic control, diabetic patients use a portable glucometer for glycemic self-monitoring and need to prick their fingertips three or more times a day, generating a huge discomfort throughout their lives. Our goal here is to present a review with very recent emerging studies in the field of noninvasive diagnosis and to emphasize that smartphone-based photoplethysmography (spPPG), powered by artificial intelligence, might be a trend to self-monitor blood glucose levels. In photoplethysmography, a light source travels through the tissue, interacts with the interstitium and with cells and molecules present in the blood. Reflection of light occurs as it passes through the biological tissues and a photodetector can capture these interactions. When using a smartphone, the built-in flashlight is a white light-emitting LED and the camera works as a photodetector. The higher the concentration of circulating glucose, the greater the absorbance and, consequently, the lesser the reflected light intensity will be. Due to these optical phenomena, the signal intensity captured will be inversely proportional to the blood glucose level. Furthermore, we highlight the microvascular changes in the progression of diabetes that can interfere in the signals captured by the photodetector using spPPG, due to the decrease of peripheral blood perfusion, which can be confused with high blood glucose levels.

However, the pain sensation due to finger pricking is not only an inconvenience to patients, but can also reduce compliance with diabetes management. A reliable, mobile, easy-to-use, and noninvasive glucometer can address this problem. Noninvasive optical signals, such as those used to obtain a photoplethysmogram (PPG), have recently been used to measure human physiological and vascular conditions and have been adopted to estimate glucose. In this study, we conducted a clinical trial to acquire the PPG signals using wearable devices from nine type 2 diabetic patients. The global and personalized models were built using random forest and adaboost regression models. The accuracy of the models was determined by the tenfold cross validation and leave-one-out validation approaches. The results show that it is feasible to attain 90% accurate glucose predictions. Therefore, diabetic patients can use a wearable noninvasive glucometer utilizing the PPG signals. © 2012 IEEE.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076349257"

Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal may be used to measure the variations in blood glucose concentration. However, the literature reveals that physiological perturbations such as temperature, skin moisture, and sweat lead to less accurate NIBG measurements. The task of minimizing the effect of these perturbations for accurate measurements is an important research area. Therefore, in the present work, galvanic skin response (GSR) and temperature measurements along with PPG were used to measure blood glucose noninvasively. The data extracted from the sensors were used to estimate blood glucose concentration with the help of two machine learning (ML) techniques, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The accuracy of proposed multisensor system was evaluated by pairing and comparing noninvasive measurements with invasively measured readings. The study was performed on 50 nondiabetic subjects with body mass index (BMI) 27.3±63 kg/m2.

Because reliable non-invasive VTT measurements are difficult, as an alternative we measure pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is defined as the time between the R-wave on electrocardiogram and arrival of the resulting pulse wave in a distal location measured with photoplethysmography (PPG). The time between electrical activation of the ventricles and the resulting pulse wave after opening of the aortic valve is called the pre-ejection period (PEP), a component of PTT. The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of PEP at rest, to establish how accurate PTT is as approximation of VTT. Methods PTT was measured and PEP was assessed with echocardiography (gold standard) in three groups of 20 volunteers: 1) a control group without cardiovascular disease aged <50 years and 2) aged >50 years, and 3) a group with cardiovascular risk factors, defined as arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, kidney failure and diabetes mellitus. Results Per group, the mean PEP was: 1) 58.5 ± 13.0 ms, 2) 52.4 ± 11.9 ms, and 3) 57.6 ± 11.6 ms. However, per individual the standard deviation was much smaller, i.e. 1) 2.0-5.9 ms, 2) 2.8-5.1 ms, and 3) 1.6-12.0 ms, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean PEP of the 3 groups (p = 0.236). Conclusion In conclusion, the intra-individual variability of PEP is small. A change in PTT in a person at rest is most probably the result of a change in VTT rather than of PEP. Thus, PTT at rest is an easy, non-invasive and accurate approximation of VTT for monitoring arterial stiffness. © 2018 Kortekaas et al.

Our proposed work aims at leveraging pulse oximeter chips in current-day fitness trackers for real-time continuous monitoring of pH in sweat. We achieve that by fabricating a highly responsive and long-term reusable pH sweat sensor on a flexible material to achieve skin conformity, targeting the sensor to work at the reflected infrared (880nm) and red (660nm) photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal intensities recorded by pulse oximeters. The sensor can be readily mounted atop any wearable with a pulse oximeter. We have successfully demonstrated a low-cost, low-power, highly-responsive and long-term reusable wrist-worn wearable prototype, pH Watch, for real-time continuous monitoring of pH value of sweat. We conducted on-body trials with 10 participants and pH Watch achieves an accuracy of $\approx$91%. We also showed that the integration of our sweat sensor does not hinder the pulse oximeter from measuring heart rate and SpO\textsubscript2, and users can continue with their daily activities with motion artifacts removed efficiently from PPG signals using the TROIKA framework, resulting in heart rate and SpO\textsubscript2 measurements with an accuracy of $\approx$95% and $\approx$96% respectively when validated against commercial finger pulse oximeter measurements. To the best of our knowledge, pH Watch is the first demonstration of a reusable sweat sensor that can be readily integrated into today's smart watches with pulse oximeters, paving the way for ubiquitous sensing of biomarkers. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069189676"

If the proper treatment is not taken and the glucose level is not kept within the normal range, it can damage vital organs of the human body. Due to this, it is important to check the blood glucose level regularly. There are different types of invasive glucometers available in the market. These invasive methods need a blood sample which causes pain, time-consuming, and higher cost. For this, a noninvasive method is badly needed. In this study, an easily usable noninvasive blood glucose monitoring device is developed that can measure glucose level continuously and eliminates the drawbacks of the invasive system. Near-infrared spectroscopy and transmission photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to estimate blood glucose concentration. 940nm wavelength light is placed on a fingertip and the output of the optical sensor is filtered, amplified and fed to Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller based on Atmega328. After regression analysis, the predicted glucose level is displayed on the LCD screen. The result of the implemented device is compared with a commercially available invasive glucometer and the average error is less than 4 % which shows that the device is reliable to estimate blood glucose concentration. © 2018 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062858571"

Atherosclerosis may occur in both lower and upper peripheral arteries, causing progressive dialysis access stenosis in HD patients. To assess the risk of PAD, non-invasive bilateral photoplethysmography (PPG) can be used to obtain continuous variations in blood flow volume in in vivo examinations. The authors propose an astable multivibrator to model the peripheral circulation system and to produce PPG oscillation with time constants, duty ratio (rising time), and amplitude ratio of systolic and diastolic pressures. Then, the bilateral differences in the time constant and duty ratio are used to separate the normal condition from PAD. The machine learning decision-making process utilises a screening method to automatically detect subjects with and without the risk of PAD. The radial-based function is employed to parameterise the similarity and dissimilarity levels using probability values. Colour relation analysis incorporates the probability values into the perceptual colour relationships for PAD screening. The experimental results indicate that in comparison with bilateral timing parameters, degree of stenosis, and resistive index, the proposed screening method is efficient in preventing complications of PAD and is easily implemented in an embedded system. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Two representative wavelengths were used; 1160 nm, a window through the absorption spectra of water and alcohol, and 1600 nm around where water absorption is high and there is an absorption peak of blood glucose. Simultaneous transmission-type measurements were made with conventional PPG and with ISPPG for each wavelength in the tips of index fingers of both hands in a total of 10 healthy young male and female volunteers (21.7 ± 1.6 years old). During a 5 min period in which subjects were in a relaxed state we determined the signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, and the PPG detectability (or sensitivity) by the two techniques. SNR during the test period was significantly higher with ISPPG as compared with conventional PPG, especially for the 1600 nm wavelength. PPG signals with 1600 nm could scarcely be detected by conventional PPG, while they could be detected with good sensitively by ISPPG. We conclude that under controlled conditions ISPPG has better SNR and higher sensitivity than conventional transmission PPG, especially in wavelength regions where water absorption is high but where there is potential for practical measurement of blood constituents including glucose. © 2015 Yamakoshi et al.

Photoplethysmography is a non-invasive technique to evaluate endothelial dysfunction based on the emission of infra-red light on the skin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate endothelial function by photoplethysmography in patients with type 2 DM without evidence of vascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study of patients with and without DM was undertaken. Endothelial function was evaluated using photoplethysmographic waves taking into consideration the shape of the curve and time of maximum amplitude/total time of the curve (TMA/TT) before and after ischemia induced by arterial obstruction. RESULTS: In 174 subjects included, a greater basal TMA/TT index was found in diabetics, even after adjusting for age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism. The percentage of change in amplitude post-ischemia compared to basal value was diminished in diabetics (p=0.030). Persons with diabetes, with and without endothelial dysfunction, had comparable HbA1c concentrations; but diabetics with endothelial dysfunction had lower serum concentration of HDL-C (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: More endothelial dysfunction was found in patients with diabetes. While the control of diabetes did not influence endothelial dysfunction, it was associated with lower HDL cholesterol.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979993366"

Methods: Totally, 111 subjects (70 healthy and 41 diabetic) were recruited. Demographic, blood pressure and anthropometric data were recorded. Blood was collected for determining serum cholesterol, total triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin concentrations. Arterial stiffness was assessed with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, crest time and inter-digital volume pulse differences. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated high inter-digital volume pulse difference sensitivity to glycated haemoglobin level over 6.5%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated significant correlation between inter-digital volume pulse difference and electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity (r = 0.692, p < 0.001). Compared with electrocardiogram-based pulse wave velocity, inter-digital volume pulse difference exhibited highly significant correlations with age, glycated haemoglobin level, pulse pressure, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, crest time, high-density lipoprotein and systolic blood pressure (all ps < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated successful application of a novel non-invasive waveform contour index, inter-digital volume pulse difference, in differentiating young from aged subjects and patients with good diabetic control from those with poor diabetic control but also validated its use in identifying arteriosclerosis risks. The results, therefore, endorse its domestic application as non-invasive tool for arteriosclerosis risk screening. © The Author(s) 2017.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019044343"

It affects approximately 5–10% of the population. The most common causes of upper extremity arterial disease are atherosclerosis and embolic disease. Some common symptoms of upper arterial disease include dysesthesia, paresthesia, pallor, cold intolerance, ulceration, pain, or weakness in one or both extremities. The vascular system plays a vital role in the delivering of nutrients and clearing metabolic waste products from the peripheral tissues and also helps maintain an individual’s systemic core temperature. In a majority of patients, the deep and superficial palmar arches provide the dominant blood supply to the hand. The arches are a continuation of the radial and ulnar arteries. These arches are typically connected in approximately 80% of patients. In order to accurately diagnose upper extremity arterial disease, a noninvasive upper extremity physiologic examination is of importance to determine treatment options for patients. The physiologic examination includes upper extremity segmental pressures known as wrist-brachial index, Doppler waveforms; digital evaluations include photoplethysmography and pressures of the digits known as the digital-brachial index. Physiologic tests are indirect examinations. The upper extremity arterial physiologic examination is always completed bilaterally in order to determine if the disease is present in one or both extremities and also assists in the diagnosis of disease severity. The vascular physiologic examination should focus on the symptoms presented by the patient during the history. However, a complete vascular examination is appropriate given the diffuse nature of the atherosclerotic disease process. © 2018, SAGE Publications Ltd.

The development and progression of arterial vascular disease is a multifactorial process. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease mediate their effects by altering the structure, properties and function of wall and endothelial components of the arterial blood vessels that vary between different vascular beds. Monitoring arterial vascular walls as well as risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and other blood biochemical profiles can potentially help to identify individuals having an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Pulse wave analysis has been shown to provide valuable information on aortic stiffness and elasticity, and it has been widely used to evaluate the vascular effects of aging, hypertension and atherosclerosis. The second derivative of the PPG or acceleration photoplethysmogram (APG) was developed as a method allowing more accurate recognition of the inflection points and easier interpretation of the original plethysmogram wave. Although obtained from the periphery of the circulation, APG provides information about both central and peripheral arterial properties. A computer based PPG analyzer was developed. With the APG signal, four separate systole waves (named a-d) and a diastole wave (named e) were obtained. A study with 40 people, 20 healthy volunteers and 20 subjects with previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease (diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, hypertension) was carried out. A t-tested distribution between healthy volunteers and patients showed a significant differences in calculated parameters: b/a (-0.742 vs -0.361, p <0.0001), d/a (-0.083 vs -0.482, p < 0.0001), e/a (0.182 vs 0.061, p< 0.0001), and for c/a (-0.039 vs -0.148, p < 0.005).

There is a need for efficient therapy, which can be via self-monitoring of blood glucose levels to provide tight glycemic control for reducing the risks of severe health complications. Advancements in diabetes technology can nowadays offer different sensor approaches, even for continuous blood glucose monitoring. Non-invasive blood glucose assays have been promised for many years and various vibrational spectroscopy-based methods of the skin are candidates for achieving this goal. Due to the small spectral signatures of the glucose hidden among a largely variable background, the largest signal-to-noise ratios and multivariate calibration are essential to provide the method applicability for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Besides multiparameter approaches, recently presented devices based on photoplethysmography with wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared range are evaluated for their potential of providing reliable blood glucose concentration predictions.

We used wavelet transform to study the microcirculatory regulatory mechanism in three different groups (18-diabetic, 8-peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 14 healthy controls) using toe photoplethysmogram (PPG) and 11 different features were derived. Compared to healthy subjects we obtained a significant decrease in the neurogenic (VNe: 286.41 vs. 125.29 (a. u), p-value = 0.000), myogenic (VMe: 281.55 vs. 29.02, p-value = 0.000) and respiratory activity (VRe: 37.68 vs. 9.35, p-value = 0.022) in the diabetic group and significant increase in the cardiac activity (VCe: 19.69 vs. 33.89, p-value = 0.007) in PAD group. Result of linear multiple regressions analysis showed a significant negative association of age and BMI with myogenic activity (p-value = 0.002, r-value = 0.173) and neurogenic activity (p-value = 0.036, r-value = 0.375) respectively. Our study showed that PPG signal can be used as a non-invasive tool for studying the vasomotion impairment in the diabetic patient during resting condition.

Methods Twenty-two antiphospholipid syndrome (APL) patients and 66 age-, sex-, height-, and blood pressure-matched controls were evaluated. Second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) was used as a noninvasive method to evaluate the pulse wave. The b/a and d/a indices, which reflect, respectively, large-vessel and small-vessel properties, were calculated from the SDPTG waveform components. Vascular age index was also determined. Results Arterial thrombosis occurred in 59.1% (13/22) of APL patients, with a predominance of stroke episodes (61.5%). Venous thromboembolism was observed in 36.4% (all deep venous thrombosis), and obstetric complications in 36.4%. Frequency of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and dyslipidemia was comparable in APL patients and control subjects (P > 0.05). Concerning plethysmography findings, b/a ratio was higher in patients than in control subjects (-0.44 ± 0.16 vs.-0.54 ± 0.18, P = 0.034), whereas d/a ratio (-0.30 ± 0.16 vs.-0.31 ± 0.18, P = 0.83) was comparable. Moreover, SDPTG (-0.16 ± 0.35 vs.-0.30 ± 0.38, P = 0.16) and vascular age index values (53.5 ± 11.6 vs. 51.8 ± 16.1, P = 0.65) were alike in both groups. Regarding disease-related factors, patients with arterial and venous thrombosis had similar b/a, d/a, and vascular age indices (P = 0.95; P = 0.06; P = 0.12, respectively). Conclusions The higher b/a ratio in APL patients suggests decreased distensibility of large arteries and may be why APL patients are at higher risk for cardiovascular events. The d/a ratio, that is considered a marker of small vessel vascular resistance, was not different than controls. Further studies are needed to evaluate vascular factors that predispose APL patients to atherosclerotic events. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

NIR LED (Light Emitting diode) of appropriate wavelengths were used to construct a finger clip. A separate Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was constructed; that connects to the finger clip and acquires the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal at three separate NIR wavelengths. The PPG signal can be used to detect the concentartion of Glucose and Insulin in blood. The PCB has a WiFi module interfaced within it; that supports Internet connectivity and uploads the time series data of insulin and glucose to a server.

Since blood glucose is an important indicator of health issues, frequent blood glucose measurement is required by a great number of people. Non-invasive methods are getting popular for such measurements since painful collection of blood is not required. In non-invasive methods, blood glucose level is recorded by exploiting the relationship of blood glucose level with various biological signals and parameters. This paper addresses the relationship of glucose level with PPG (photoplethysmoram) signal which can provide information regarding the volume of blood flowing in the test region through exposure of that particular region to infrared light of certain wavelengths. A dataset has been created by collecting the PPG signal of 30 people along with their blood glucose level, measured in invasive way both before and 2 hours after breakfast. A CNN model has been trained with this dataset to exploit the relationship of glucose level with PPG signal and thus the glucose level of blood have been measured.

We used near-infrared light at 1160-nm, a window in the water absorption spectrum and strong BAL absorption peak, and 1600-nm, a strong absorption peak of BGL. In 8 volunteers, simultaneous measurements of both isFPPG and tmFPPG from the index fingers with both wavelengths were made using a laser-based experimental setup.

It does not receive enough blood flow to keep up with demand. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain while walking which is known as claudication. It is a common manifestation of type-2 Diabetes, but the relationship between other vascular diseases and lower limb peripheral arterial disease (LLPAD) has been poorly understood and investigated. Methods: When assessing a patient with clinical LLPAD, 2 methods are used to establish a diagnosis: one is noninvasive testing and other is invasive. Invasive methods are painful and get so bad that some people need to have a leg surgery. People with diabetes are at increased risk for amputation, and it is used only when the damage is very severe. Results: Diagnosis of LLPAD begins with a physical examination, patient history, and certain questionnaire, and noninvasive mode of diagnosis is started for the screening of patients. Clinicians check for weak pulses in the legs and then decide for further diagnosis. This article discusses the prevalence of LLPAD worldwide and in India, along with the clinical effectiveness and limitations of these methods in case of diabetes. Conclusions: The focus of this review is to discuss only those noninvasive methods that are widely used for screening of LLPAD, such as ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and use of photoplethysmogram (PPG) especially in case of diabetic patients. Also, this article gives an overview of the work carried out using ABI, TBI, and PPG for detection of LLPAD. These tests are not painful and could be performed in a cost-effective manner to avoid delays in screening/diagnosis and also reduce costs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049322643"

The performance of each system model is evaluated on the basis of, (i) Coefficient of determination i.e. R2, (ii) Spearman’s coefficient of correlation, (iii) Pearson’s coefficient of correlation and (iv) Clarke error grid analysis. We observed that Single Pulse Analysis technique shows better performance as compared to Frame based technique. The highest R2 value (0.95) for Single Pulse analysis is obtained for K-fold RF network. For Single Pulse Analysis, all other models also show comparable BGL estimation accuracy with R2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.94. According to Clarke error grid analysis the values that lie in class A and class B are clinically accepted. We obtained highest prediction accuracy for Single Pulse analysis with K-fold random forest with 93.2% (class A) and 6.8% (class B). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084788557"

Heart & it's related parameters are very important for good health condition. Statistics from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2008, around 616K people died of heart disease and 25% cause of total death and in 2010 the percentage grew up to 31%. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, overweight are some of the real cause of heart disease. To determine heart state, ECG is a proven and well accepted system. But, the device is expensive and requires training. ECG sensor measures the bio-potential generated by the electrical signals that is responsible to control the expansion and contraction of heart chambers. In this article, we have focused literature review on Non-Invasive cardiovascular monitoring researches undertaken so far to provide new possibilities and research trends so that we can monitor our health better and take precautions earlier with the use and advancement of Computer Science & Technology. Here we have primarily focused on PPG signal and its application to measure important blood parameters like Glucose, HB, SP02 that indirectly or directly can provide us a status of our health when required. Recent report suggests that PPG is very useful for measuring heart rates, arterial age (with PPG derivatives), blood pressure, oxygen saturation, emotion detection, respiratory rate etc. Accurate measurement of PPG can open up new possibilities in non-invasive computer aided cardiac research for smart care-giving. © 2018 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062936662"

First, we compared PPGs with three wavelengths: 808 nm (without water absorption), 1160 nm (with weak water absorption), and 1600 nm (with nearly peak BGL absorption and strong water absorption), while the source-detector spacing was successively increased circumferentially around a fingertip. In 10 healthy subjects, we observed clear cardiac-related pulsatile components of PPG signals at 808 and 1160 nm in any incident positions with more than 15 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), but reliable PPG detections at 1600 nm with more than 10 dB of S/N was only possible when the source-detector distance was less than 3 mm around the fingertip circumference. Second, with this arrangement, an experiment was performed using six wavelengths to cover glucose absorption bands (from 1550 to 1749 nm), obtaining pulsatile PPG signals with more or less 15 dB of S/N. Through the present experiments, this orthogonal arrangement of the source and detector to detect forward- and side-scattered radiation through the tissue is appropriate for PPG measurements with wavelength regions where there is potential for BGL measurement. © The Authors.

A good number of invasive techniques to measure blood glucose levels have been devised in the past few decades that had been a mixed blessing because it carried multiple limitations along with beneficial sides. Pain, discomfort, and risks of pathogenic infection were some of the basic drawbacks. So, per the demand of time, our main objective of this paper is to introduce a method of blood glucose level measurement that is non-invasive and can overcome the former limitations with better accuracy in a very cost-effective way. Blood glucose concentration can be measured using the PPG (Photoplethysmogram) signal. But to gain higher accuracy we need to consider the physiological variations which lead to erroneous measurement of glucose levels. Using GSR (Galvanic Skin Response) sensor data, these perturbations can be minimized. So, in our model PPG sensor and GSR sensor have been used to accurately measure blood glucose levels. Extracted data from these two sensors as well as recorded blood glucose measurement using conventional glucometer were applied in a deep learning algorithm to measure blood glucose level non-invasively. Then the output of our proposed system was compared to conventional invasive technique. The results showed that our proposed multi sensor-based system improves prediction error of glucose level. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084053462"

The long-term presence of elevated blood sugar levels commonly results in peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with PVO disease have decreased walking capability and life quality in diabetes mellitus and poor peripheral circulation of PVO causes morbidity like infection and amputation of the legs or feet of diabetics. This progressively vascular occlusion is often ignored by the patients and primary care physicians in early stage. Therefore, a reliable method of diagnostic assistance is crucial for early diagnosis and monitoring of PVO and prevention of amputation. Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for detecting blood volume changes in peripheral vascular bed. Literature indicates that the pulse transit time increases and waveform shape changes increase in PPG of the vascular occlusion. PPG pulses of feet gradually become asynchronous due to the different speed of deteriorating patency and collateral circulation in the peripheral arteries. We utilized synchronizing chaotification to compare the bilateral similarity and asymmetry of PPG signals, and applied SVM to estimate three degrees of PVO. Among 33 subjects tested, this classification technique could recognize various butterfly motion patterns representing severities successfully including normal condition, lower-degree disease, and higher-degree disease. The proposed method has potential for providing diagnostic assistance for PVO of diabetics and other high-risk populations, with efficiency and higher accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The system consists of a front end that extracts a set of features form the pulse oximeter signal. These features are based on physiological considerations. The set of features were the input of a machine-learning algorithm that determined the class of the input sample, i.e., whether the subject had diabetes or not.

There is a need to develop a non-invasive monitoring system that avoids the risk of infection problems and pain caused by invasive monitoring techniques. This paper presents a method for developing a noninvasive technique to predict the blood glucose concentration (BCG) based on the Near-infrared (NIR) light sensor. A prototype is developed using a finger sensor based on LED of 940 nm wavelength to collect photoplethysmography (PPG) signal which is variable depending on the glucose concentration variance, a module circuit to preprocess PPG signals is realized, which includes an amplifier and analog filter circuits, an Arduino UNO is used to analog-to-digital conversion. A digital Butterworth filterer is used to remove PPG signal trends, then detect the PPG data peaks to determine the relationship between the PPG signal and (BCG) and use it as input parameters to build the calibration model based on linear regression. Experiments show that the Root Mean Squares Error (RMSE) of the prediction is between 8.264mg/dL and 13.166 mg/dL, the average of RMSE is about 10.44mg/dL with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.839, it is observed that the prediction of glucose concentration is in the clinically acceptable region of the standard Clark Error Grid (CEG). © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076397888"

The insidious onset of type 2 diabetes delays diagnosis and increases morbidity2. Given the multifactorial vascular effects of diabetes, we hypothesized that smartphone-based photoplethysmography could provide a widely accessible digital biomarker for diabetes. Here we developed a deep neural network (DNN) to detect prevalent diabetes using smartphone-based photoplethysmography from an initial cohort of 53,870 individuals (the ‘primary cohort’), which we then validated in a separate cohort of 7,806 individuals (the ‘contemporary cohort’) and a cohort of 181 prospectively enrolled individuals from three clinics (the ‘clinic cohort’). The DNN achieved an area under the curve for prevalent diabetes of 0.766 in the primary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.750–0.782; sensitivity 75%, specificity 65%) and 0.740 in the contemporary cohort (95% confidence interval: 0.723–0.758; sensitivity 81%, specificity 54%). When the output of the DNN, called the DNN score, was included in a regression analysis alongside age, gender, race/ethnicity and body mass index, the area under the curve was 0.830 and the DNN score remained independently predictive of diabetes. The performance of the DNN in the clinic cohort was similar to that in other validation datasets. There was a significant and positive association between the continuous DNN score and hemoglobin A1c (P ≤ 0.001) among those with hemoglobin A1c data. These findings demonstrate that smartphone-based photoplethysmography provides a readily attainable, non-invasive digital biomarker of prevalent diabetes. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089507305"

Determination of blood glucose levels is the key link in diabetes care. The traditional measurement method firstly collects blood drops, and then uses the blood analyzer for electrochemical analysis. The traditional method is inconvenient, algesiogenic and easily cause infection. With the development of chemometric methods, infrared spectroscopy has been widely used in the field of blood glucose measurement and medicine care. The non-invasive blood glucose measurement scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy is a way which is more efficiently, without damage and chemical reagents. In this paper, we proposed a non-invasive blood glucose detection and analysis the scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy. In order to avoid the influence of the environment during the measuring process and considering the individual differences, we use the wave acquisition system to collect human pulse wave, and reduce the noise of the pulse wave signal first. By comparing the actual measured data with the data obtained in the traditional way, we can establish models to predict the blood glucose levels and achieve non-invasive blood glucose measurement using spectrum analysis technology. In the end, we improve the models by analyzing the relationship between individual factors and the pulse wave signal. The experimental results show that the method can effectively determine the blood glucose levels, and it is more convenient, safer and healthier than the traditional method, which can effectively reduce the time cost and the money cost. © 2018 Optics InfoBase Conference Papers.

With its advancement, DM-related complications are also increasing. We used characteristic features of toe photoplethysmogram for the detection of type-2 DM using support vector machine (SVM). We collected toe PPG signal, from 58 healthy and 83 type-2 DM subjects. From each PPG signal 37 different features were extracted for further classification. To improve the performance of SVM and reduce the noisy data we employed hybrid feature selection technique that reduces the feature set of 37 to 10 on the basis of majority voting. Using 10 selected features set, we gained an accuracy of 97.87%, sensitivity of 98.78% and specificity of 96.61%. Further for the validation of our method we need to do random population test, so that it can be used as a non-invasive screening tool. Photoplethysmogram is an economic, technically easy and completely non-invasive method for both physician and subject.

Since CAD is the highest risk marker for sudden cardiac death, the study objective is to determine whether an independent cardiovascular risk score based on these markers can be used alongside known conventional cardiovascular risk markers to strengthen the understanding of a patient’s vascular state.; Materials and methods: Sixty-five subjects (13 women) with a mean age of 62.9 years (range 40–80 years) who were diagnosed with CAD using coronary angiography (group 1) and seventy-two subjects (29 women) with a mean age of 45.1 years (range 18–85 years) who claimed they were healthy (group 2) were included in the study. These subjects underwent examination with the TM-Oxi and SudoPath systems at IPC Heart Care Centers in Mumbai, India. The TM-Oxi system takes measurements from a blood pressure device and a pulse oximeter. The SudoPath measures galvanic skin response to assess the sudomotor pathway function. Spectral analysis of the photoplethysmograph (PTG) waveform and electrochemical galvanic skin response allow the TM-Oxi and SudoPath systems to calculate several homeostatic markers, such as the PTG index (PTGi), PTG very low frequency index (PTGVLFi), and PTG ratio (PTGr). The focus of this study was to evaluate these markers (PTGi, PTGVLFi, and PTGr) in CAD patients against a control group, and to calculate an independent cardiovascular risk factor score: the PTG cardiovascular disease risk score (PTG CVD), calculated solely from these markers. We compared PTGi, PTGVLFi, PTGr, and PTG CVD scores between the CAD patient group and the healthy control group. Statistical analyses were performed using receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the markers to detect CAD at optimal cutoff values for PTGi, PTGVLFi, PTGr, and PTG CVD. In addition, correlation analyses between these markers and conventional autonomic nervous system and endothelial function markers were performed to understand the possible underlying physiological sources of the differences observed in marker values between CAD patients and healthy control patients. Additionally, t-tests were performed between two subgroups of the CAD patient group to determine whether diabetic or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients have significantly different PTGi marker values.; Results: Each spectral analysis PTG marker yielded a high specificity and sensitivity to detect CAD. Most notably, the PTG CVD score had a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 96.8%, at a cutoff of 2, when used to detect CAD (P=0.0001; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve =0.967). The PTG spectral analysis markers were well-correlated to other autonomic nervous system and endothelial function markers. CAD diabetic patients (n=27) had a lower PTGi value compared with the CAD non-diabetic patients (n=38): and patients that underwent CABG (n=18) had a higher PTGi value compared with the CAD without CABG surgery patients (n=47).; Conclusion: The spectral analysis of the photoplethysmography method is noninvasive, fast, operator-independent, and cost-effective, as only an oximeter and galvanic skin response device are required in order to assess in a single testing the autonomic nervous system and endothelial function. The spectral analysis techniques used on the photoplethysmogram, as outlined in this study, could be useful when used alongside conventional known cardiovascular disease risk markers. © 2014 Gandhi and Rao.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84916931320"

Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals have been used as a non-invasive approach to predict diabetes. However, current methods use long, continuous signals collected in a clinical setting. This study focuses on predicting Type 2 Diabetes from short (~2.1s) PPG signals extracted from smart devices, and readily available physiological data such as age, gender, weight and height. Since this type of PPG signals can be easily extracted using mobile phones or smart wearable technology, the user can get an initial prediction without entering a medical facility. Through the analysis of morphological features related to the PPG waveform and its derivatives, we identify features related to Type 2 Diabetes and establish the feasibility of predicting Type 2 Diabetes from short PPG signals. We cross validated several classification models based on the selected set of features to predict Type 2 Diabetes, where Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieved the highest area under the ROC curve of 79%. The successful practical implementation of the proposed system would enable people to screen themselves conveniently using their smart devices to identify the potential risk of Type 2 Diabetes and thus avoid austere complications of late detection. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068310741"

The monitoring is performed by gently pressing a wrist or fingertip onto the chemochromic mixture coating a thin glass or polymer film positioned on the back panel of a smart watch with PPG/HRM (photoplethysmographic/heart rate monitoring sensor). The various chemochromic components measure the absolute values of the following metabolites present in the sweat: acetone, acetone beta-hydroxybutirate, aceto acetate, water, carbon dioxide, lactate anion, pyruvic acid, Na and K salts. Taken together, all these parameters give information about blood glucose concentration, calculated via multivariate analysis based on neural network algorithms built into the sensor. The Clarke Error Grid shows an excellent correlation between data measured by the standard invasive glucose analyser and the present noninvasive sensor, with all points aligned along a 45-degree diagonal and contained almost exclusively in sector A. Graphs measuring glucose levels five times a day (prior, during and after breakfast and prior, during and after lunch), for different individuals (males and females) show a good correlation between the two curves of conventional, invasive meters vs. the noninvasive sensor, with an error of ±15%.

Recent evidences, however, suggest that the value of glycemia at 1 h during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is a stronger predictor for developing diabetes than the value at 2 h and that it is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Studies in cells, animals, and humans suggest that 1-h high glucose is a sufficient stimulus for increasing several cardiovascular risk factors, such as inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction, with oxidative stress generation as the possible pathogenetic factor. One-hour glucose might be more dangerous than that at 2 h simply because glycemia is higher at 1 h, during an OGTT and postmeal.

To address this problem, a power spectral density-based method was offered for determining glucose sensitive sub-bands in the nearinfrared (NIR) spectrum. The experiments were conducted using phantoms of different optical properties in-vitro conditions. The optical bands 1200-1300nm and 2100-2200nm were found feasible for measuring blood glucose. After that, a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based low cost and portable optical system was designed. It has six different NIR wavelength LEDs for illumination and an InGaAs photodiode for detection. Optical density values were calculated through the system and used as independent variables for multiple linear regression analysis. The results of blood glucose levels for 24 known healthy subjects showed that the optical system prediction was nearly 80% in the A zone and 20% in the B zone according to the Clarke Error Grid analysis.

In 2003, we introduced a method to characterise arterial mechanical properties, which we termed arterial stiffness (K). However, it is unclear whether differences in K actually indicate changes in the intensity of a noxious stimulus. Thus, we examined the relationship between stress intensity and the value of K. METHODS: Thirty patients under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two remifentanil concentration groups (2 and 6 ng/mL). After a steady concentration of remifentanil was achieved for at least 3 minutes, laryngoscopy was performed. After completion of laryngoscopy, once the K value returned to near-baseline, laryngoscopy with endotracheal intubation was performed, and the value of K after the procedure was recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: In total, data were obtained for 28 of 30 patients. The values of K before the laryngoscopy were not significantly different between the groups (2 ng/mL group: 13.1 [8.5-33.1] mmHg/%; 6 ng/mL group: 11.6 [4.3-31.4] mmHg/%; P=0.53). After laryngoscopy, K was approximately 2 times greater in the 2 ng/mL group than in the 6 ng/mL group (39.0 [13.6-115.9] mmHg/% vs. 19.0 [5.5-85.1] mmHg/%, P=0.02). After intubation also, K was approximately 2 times greater in the 2 ng/mL group (52.0 [27.7-122.0] mmHg/% vs. 24.3 [7.2-94.9] mmHg/%, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The value for arterial stiffness (K) non-proportionally changes in response to stimulus intensity; therefore, it has the potential to be used as an indicator of nociceptive stimulation intensity. © 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044872138"

Determination of blood glucose levels is the key link in diabetes care. The traditional measurement method firstly collects blood drops, and then uses the blood analyzer for electrochemical analysis. The traditional method is inconvenient, algesiogenic and easily cause infection. With the development of chemometric methods, infrared spectroscopy has been widely used in the field of blood glucose measurement and medicine care. The non-invasive blood glucose measurement scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy is a way which is more efficiently, without damage and chemical reagents. In this paper, we proposed a non-invasive blood glucose detection and analysis the scheme based on near-infrared spectroscopy. In order to avoid the influence of the environment during the measuring process and considering the individual differences, we use the wave acquisition system to collect human pulse wave, and reduce the noise of the pulse wave signal first. By comparing the actual measured data with the data obtained in the traditional way, we can establish models to predict the blood glucose levels and achieve non-invasive blood glucose measurement using spectrum analysis technology. In the end, we improve the models by analyzing the relationship between individual factors and the pulse wave signal. The experimental results show that the method can effectively determine the blood glucose levels, and it is more convenient, safer and healthier than the traditional method, which can effectively reduce the time cost and the money cost. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

The current glucose measurement approaches still rely on invasive techniques which are uncomfortable and raise the risk of infection. To facilitate daily care at home, in this article, we propose an intelligent, noninvasive blood glucose monitoring system which can differentiate a user's blood glucose level into normal, borderline, and warning based on smartphone photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The main implementation processes of the proposed system include 1) a novel algorithm for acquiring PPG signals using only smartphone camera videos; 2) a fitting-based sliding window algorithm to remove varying degrees of baseline drifts and segment the signal into single periods; 3) extracting characteristic features from the Gaussian functions by comparing PPG signals at different blood glucose levels; 4) categorizing the valid samples into three glucose levels by applying machine learning algorithms. Our proposed system was evaluated on a data set of 80 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can separate valid signals from invalid ones at an accuracy of 97.54$\%$ and the overall accuracy of estimating the blood glucose levels reaches 81.49$\%$. The proposed system provides a reference for the introduction of noninvasive blood glucose technology into daily or clinical applications.

This trial tested a wrist-borne non-invasive glucose monitor (NIGM) to measure blood glucose (BG) levels using photoplethysmographic (PPG) optical sensors. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of the device in comparison with a standard, invasive clinical method for blood glucose monitoring. Adult participants (n = 200) of both sexes from 18 to 75 were recruited for the study. Exclusion criteria: hemophilia and other serious coagulation disorders, impaired venous access, other serious medical conditions. A biosensor was placed on the right wrist of each participant for a non-invasive indirect BG measurement. In parallel, blood from the antecubital vein was collected and glucose levels were assessed with YSI 2300 Bioanalyzer. The measurements were performed twice: before and after food intake, with a 1-h interval between measurements. There were no limitations to food type and quantity. In both anteprandial (ρ = 0.8994, p < 0.0001) and postprandial (ρ =0.9382, p < 0.0001) glucose measurements, NIGM correlated with values obtained by the YSI 2300 reference device – there was no significant difference between the two methods. Plotted on a Parkes Error Grid for Type II diabetes, NIGM readings did not deviate from those of the YSI 2300 in any clinically-significant way, with the majority of correlated readings falling within Parkes zone A. Very few readings fell within Parkes zone B. In anteprandial measurements, the mean bias between methods for all patient volunteers was 3.705 ± 7.838. In postprandial measurements gave a mean bias of 1.362 ± 10.15 for all patient glucose data. The mean absolute relative difference of currently available glucometer models ranges from 5.6% to 20.8%. The NIGM falls in the lower end of this error range at 7.40–7.54%, indicating that PPG-chemochrome sensors are capable of producing results comparable with those of direct measure glucometers. Data presented here demonstrates the reliability and accuracy of the NIGM system as an adjunctive, and perhaps substitutive, non-invasive tool for blood glucose monitoring. © 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060208924"

Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR). The PPG readout circuit consists of a switched capacitor Transimpedance amplifier with 1 MΩ gain and a 10-Hz switched capacitor LPF. It allows a DC bias current rejection up to 20 μA with an input-referred current noise of 7.3 pA/√Hz. The proposed digital processor eliminates motion artifacts, and baseline drifts from PPG signal, extracts six distinct features and finally predicts the blood glucose level using Support Vector Regression with Fine Gaussian kernel (FGSVR) MLR. A novel piece-wise linear (PWL) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the FGSVR on-chip. The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with a chip area of 4.0 mm2 while consuming 1.62 mW. The glucose measurements are performed for 200 subjects with R2 of 0.937.

However, a development of the noninvasive and automated technique for routinely assessing endothelial function is still required. We evaluated the potential value of a new method to measure peripheral endothelial function with reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial volume (RH-PAV) in patients with chest pain. Methods: We used a novel oximeter-like probe to detect the peripheral arterial volume (PAV) of the finger and compared it with brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) performed in 93 consecutive patients with chest pain. The RH-PAV index was defined as the ratio of the digital pulse volume during reactive hyperemia relative to the baseline. Results: Ninety-three patients (53 men, 58 ± 5 years) completed the study, and 53 patients demonstrated coronary artery disease (CAD) following scheduled coronary angiography. There was a moderate linear relationship between PAV and FMD (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). Similar to FMD, PAV was more impaired in patients who have more cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs). The subjects with CAD had lower PAV and FMD, compared with those without CAD (1.05 ± 0.23 VS. 1.41 ± 0.37, p < 0.01; 6.7% ± 2.9% VS. 10.4% ± 2.9%, p < 0.01, respectively), and the relationships between FMD and PAV were also significant in both CAD (r = 0.54, p < 0.01) and non-CAD (r = 0.62, p < 0.01) patients. Conclusions: Endothelial function of digital artery assessed with the novel PAV method demonstrated a profile similar to that of brachial artery measured with FMD. The hyperemia PAV was decreased by factors which were considered to impair endothelial function, suggesting that PAV has the potential to be a novel method to study endothelial function. © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046427777"

In this project, a non-invasive device is designed to detect the absorption of infra-red radiations through the finger to extract Photoplethysmogram (PPG). By utilizing a couple of infrared transmitter and receiver a photoplethysmogram is gotten. The streaming blood in the finger is consumed by infrared radiation which emanates through an infrared transmitter. This assimilated radiation is returned via finger and recognized over that infrared receiver. Here, the signal got remains tiny consequently to get the accurate extraction of the signal, the offset mix of resistors and capacitors are needed. This device involves a couple of detector and receiver combined with an amplifier and filter circuit. Also, a TL084 operational amplifier is utilized. Due to weakened signal acquired from the finger, the amplification is significant. Because of the different phases of signal extraction and amplification, random noise is added. So to remove certain noises Butterworth low pass and high pass filter, a notch filter circuit is used. The data is converted using ATMEGA328 Microcontroller. Further, this data is analyzed in MATLAB and the relationship within voltage and blood glucose concentration is determined. © 2019 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080135388"

In this paper, we explore features related to heart rate variability (HRV) and signal pattern of the waveform from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal for classifying DM (Type 2). HRV features includes time-domain (F1), frequency domain (F2), non-linear features (F3) where as waveform features (F4) are one set of features such as height, width, slope and durations of pulse. The study was carried out on 50 healthy subjects and 50 DM patients. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to capture the discriminative information between the above mentioned healthy and DM categories, from the proposed features. The SVM models are developed separately using different sets of features F1, F2, F3,and F4, respectively. The classification performance of the developed SVM models using time-domain, frequency domain, non-linear and waveform features is observed to be 73%, 78%, 80% and 77%. The performance of the system using combination of all features is 82%. In this work, the performance of the DM classification system by combining the above mentioned feature sets with different percentage of discriminate features from each set is also examined. Furthermore weight based fusion is performed using confidence values obtained from each model to find the optimal set of features from each set with optimal weights for each set. The best performance accuracy of 89% is obtained by scores fusion where combinations of mixture of 90% features from the feature sets F1 and F2 and mixture of 100% features from the feature sets F3 and F4, with fusion optimal weights of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively.

However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured. Methods: Measurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning. Results: There was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P < .01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P < .01 in both cases). Conclusions: We concluded that SPP measured in the foot correlates well with toe pressure and can be substituted for toe pressure measurement in patients in whom toe pressures cannot be measured.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034234984"

Valid and reliable noninvasive tests such as the ankle-brachial index (ABI) are recommended to detect LEAD. However, ABI results can be inconclusive or the index can be elevated (ie, <1.3) in persons with calcified ankle arteries due to DM, renal failure, or arthritis. In these instances, obtaining toe pressure (TP) measurements, which correlate well with angiographic findings, is advised, providing the patient does not have vasoconstriction with cold toes or vasospastic disease. In such cases, TP can be obtained using a portable pho- toplethysmograph (PPG), which offers a simple and inexpensive method for healthcare providers in a variety of clinical settings to assess for the presence of LEAD. Portable PPG TP measurements have been found to have a high level of agreement with vascular laboratory PPG tests to detect LEAD, as well as good sensitivity and a high specificity. Adopting a TP measurement protocol of care to assess high-risk individuals such as patients with DM and elevated ABIs potentially can have a major impact on early identification of LEAD and reduce the risk of ischemia-related complications, including lower extremity wounds and amputations.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84857553737"

Conventional measures of BRS require expensive or invasive equipment for the beat-to-beat measure of blood pressure (BP). We examined the possibility of developing a simple protocol that would provide a relatively standardized BP stimulus, which might obviate the need to measure BP beat-by-beat. Methods and Results: Fifty-five patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 59 [SD 11] years) and 20 healthy control subjects (mean age 53 [SD 14] years, P not significant) underwent 5-minute recordings of BP (by photoplethysmograph) and R-R interval during 0.1-Hz controlled breathing. The size of the oscillations in BP was the same in the 2 groups (3.6 mm Hg vs 4.1 mm Hg, P = .5). There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations (77 ms vs 31 ms, P < .0001). The amplitude of the R-R interval oscillations correlated strongly with BRS (r = 0.81, P < .0001 with controlled breathing BRS, and r = 0.51, P < .0001 with α index). There was no correlation with the size of BP oscillations (r = -0.13, P not significant with controlled breathing BRS, and r = -0.15, P not significant with α index). In a separate study, a group of 22 young patients (mean age 36 years) with type I diabetes mellitus and 28 healthy control subjects (mean age 39 years) underwent measurement of resting HRV and amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during 0.1-Hz breathing. There was no significant difference in triangular index or low-frequency R-R interval power between the 2 groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the amplitude of R-R interval oscillations during controlled breathing between patients with diabetes and healthy control subjects. Total and high-frequency RR interval variability was also significantly different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: During 0.1-Hz breathing, the marked difference in BRS between patients with CHF and age-matched control subjects is the result of smaller R-R interval oscillations. In young patients with diabetes, these R-R interval oscillations are significantly smaller than age-matched control subjects, even when some measures of spontaneous HRV are not different between groups. Breathing at 0.1 Hz provides a standard BP stimulus and concentrates spectral power of heart rate at one frequency, enabling simple evaluation of BRS even when BP measurement is not available.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036187876"

Patients with PAD are mostly asymptomatic; typical early symptoms of this limb-threatening disorder are intermittent claudication and leg pain, suggesting the necessity for accurate diagnosis by invasive angiography and ankle-brachial pressure index. This index acts as a gold standard reference for PAD diagnosis and categorizes its severity into normal, low-grade and high-grade, with respective cut-off points of ≥0.9, 0.9-0.5 and <0.5. PAD can be assessed using photoplethysmography as a diagnostic screening tool, displaying changes in pulse transit time and shape, and dissimilarities of these changes between lower limbs. The present report proposed photoplethysmogram with fractional-order chaotic system to assess PAD in 14 diabetics and 11 healthy adults, with analysis of dynamic errors based on various butterfly motion patterns, and color relational analysis as classifier for pattern recognition. The results show that the classification of PAD severity among these testees was achieved with high accuracy and efficiency. This noninvasive methodology potentially provides timing and accessible feedback to patients with asymptomatic PAD and their physicians for further invasive diagnosis or strict management of risk factors to intervene in the disease progression. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880799594"

The utility of stiffness index (SI) derived from digital volume pulse (DVP) analysis in CVD risk screening is not established. Methods: Using a representative sample of individuals from local communities (West Midlands, UK), we determined the performance of SI in the discrimination of increasing CVD risk. Arterial stiffness was measured by DVP photoplethysmography (PCA 2; Micro Medical) using a direct, standardized approach. CVD risk assessment was performed in accordance with the Joint British Society guidelines (JBS2). Results: Of our cohort of 247 individuals (51% male; mean age 55.2 (s.d. 10.3) years), 187 were apparently healthy and 60 had established CVD risk factors (diabetes mellitus: 33%, hypertension: 77.8%, hypercholesteremia: 61%). On univariate analysis, SI was strongly associated with CVD risk (the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) based HeartScore) (Pearson correlation coefficient (R): 0.56, P ≤ 0.001) and increased in an ordinal fashion from ""low risk"" to ""medium risk"" to ""high risk"" to ""very high risk"" (pseudo R2 = 0.30; P < 0.001). In receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, SI was the best discriminator between low to medium risk and high-risk categories (area under curve (AUC): 0.76 (95% CI 0.64-0.88), P < 0.001) when compared to total cholesterol, plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and waist-to-hip ratio and had the utility to discriminate the individuals with known CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. Conclusion: Noninvasive measurements of arterial stiffness may aid the optimal stratification of CVD risk in an apparently healthy population. © 2008 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-47749127277"

There is also a positive correlation between PWV and arterial blood pressure. The changes of PWV in response to general anesthesia and surgical stimulation remain unclear. The aim of this study was to continuously monitor the PWV, blood pressure and heart rate, and to assess their correlations during general anesthesia in women receiving gynecologic surgery. Methods: The values of PWV were obtained from calculation of the finger-to-toe distance divided by the transit time using dual-channel photoplethysmography system. The values of PWV, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate were recorded before anesthesia induction, 5 min before incision, at incision, in continuation for at least 30 min thereafter, and 5 min after discontinuation of sevoflurane. The correlations between PWV and SBP, DBP and heart rate during the general anesthesia were analyzed using Pearson's correlation test. Results: The serial records of PWV and hemodynamic parameters showed that PWV, SBP, DBP, and heart rate decreased after induction of anesthesia. SBP and DBP increased after surgical incision. There was a trend of progressively declining of PWV and DBP during the general anesthesia but SBP and heart rate remained stationary. All the values of PWV, SBP, DBP, and heart rate increased after discontinuation of anesthesia. There were significant correlations between PWV and SBP (r = 0.4558, P < 0.0001), between PWV and DBP (r = 0.2719, P < 0.0001), between PWV and pulse pressure (r = 0.2067, P < 0.0001), and between PWV and mean arterial pressure (r = 0.3969, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: We could evaluate the serial changes of PWV in response to general anesthesia and surgical stimulation using a simple and noninvasive dual-channel photoplethysmography system.

Methods: Two hundred eleven patients (age range, 45 to 90 years; mean age, 69.6 ± 9.2 years; 170 men and 41 women), 403 limbs with arteriosclerosis obliterans, were included in this study. Half of the patients had diabetes or were receiving dialysis or both. Results: Significant correlations were found between SPP and ankle blood pressure (ABP), SPP and toe blood pressure (TBP), and SPP and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure (tcPO2) (P < .0001, r = 0.75; P < .0001, r = 0.85; P < .0001, r = 0.62; respectively). In 94 limbs with ulcer or gangrene, wound healing was predicted by the SPP. The mean SPP (mean ± SD) in the healed-wound group (25 limbs, 48 ± 20 mm Hg) was greater than that in the unhealed-wound group (69 limbs, 23 ± 11 mm Hg) (P <.001). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the cut-off value of SPP was 40 mm Hg (sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 88%). Furthermore, we studied whether the combination of SPP and another measurement could predict wound healing more accurately than could any single variable. There was a strong correlation between SPP, TBP, and the healing rate (P < .001, r = 0.69) and healing could be accurately predicted if the SPP was greater than 40 mm Hg and if the TBP was greater than 30 mm Hg. Conclusions: Our results suggest that measurement of SPP is an objective method for assessing the severity of peripheral arterial disease or for predicting wound healing. © 2008 The Society for Vascular Surgery.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-38649112313"

The present study sought to elucidate independent determinants of the SDPTG among various cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Japanese men. The SDPTG was obtained from the cuticle of the left-hand forefinger in 973 male workers (mean age: 44±6 years) during a medical checkup at a company. The SDPTG indices (b/a and d/a) were calculated from the height of the wave components. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that the independent determinants of an increased b/a (highest quartile of the b/a) were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12 per 1-year increase, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.09-1.15), hypertension (OR: 1.65, 95% Cl: 1.03-2.65), dyslipidemia (OR: 1.51, 95% Cl: 1.09-2.09), impaired fasting glucose/diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.43, 95% Cl: 1.16-5.07), and a lack of regular exercise (OR: 2.00, 95% Cl: 1.29-3.08). Similarly, independent determinants of a decreased d/a (lowest quartile of the d/a) were age (OR: 1.11 per 1-year increase, 95% Cl: 1.08-1.14), hypertension (OR: 3.44, 95% Cl, 2.20-5.38), and alcohol intake 6 or 7 days per week (OR: 2.70, 95% Cl: 1.80-4.06). No independent association was observed between the SDPTG indices and blood leukocyte count or serum C-reactive protein levels.

The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and PWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complior device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 ± 4 m/sec v 12.4 ± 2 m/sec, P < .001), PTG AUI (0.322 ± 0.16 v 0.252 ± 0.09, P < .001), and SDPTG AI (- 0.093 ± 0.03 v -0.271 ± 0.018, P < .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients > 60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG AI by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives.

Doppler ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) is considered the non-invasive screening test of choice to detect peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Photoplethysmography (PPG) and pulse oximetry (PO) are also suitable alternatives; however, correlation and validation are yet to be established. We compare Doppler ABI, PPG-derived and PO-derived indices to detect PAD. Design. Prospective case control study. Methods. Forty-six subjects were evaluated by PO, PPG, and Doppler ABI. Twenty-three patients had known PAD and 24 were healthy subjects with no signs of PAD. Pressure in arms, fingers, toes, and ankles were measured, and different pressure indices calculated. Results. Groups of control participants and patients with peripheral vascular disease were significantly different with regards to age, prevalence of diabetes, and prevalence of hypertension. Doppler ABI was most sensitive (81.4%) to diagnose PAD in the main study group (n ≤ 46). In patients with diabetes and/or chronic renal failure, Doppler ABI had lower sensitivity (69.2-71.4%) and was comparable to the other diagnostic tests; photoplethysmography toe-finger index (TFI) achieved the highest sensitivity in these patients. (84.6-85.7%). Conclusions. Doppler ABI had the highest sensitivity to diagnose PAD overall. In patients with diabetes and/or chronic renal failure, Doppler ABI had lower sensitivity and was comparable to most of the other diagnostic tests. PPG TFI may provide greater sensitivity in the screening of patients with diabetes and CRF for PVD.

Compared to Western countries, in Asia, T2DM occurs in patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) due to central obesity and decreased pancreatic β-cell function. The efficacy of laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB) in obese patients with T2DM has been proven by numerous studies. Treatment outcomes of LMGB for non-obese T2DM patients are also estimated to be excellent. The aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LMBG in non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m2). Methods: Ten consecutive patients underwent LMGB at our hospital from August 2009 to October 2009. Preoperative data including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2 h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG) were compared with data collected at 1, 3, and 6 postoperative months. Results: All procedures were completed laparoscopically. Mean age of the patients was 46.9 years, mean BMI was 27.2 kg/m2, mean operative time was 150.5 min, and mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.3 days. Neither mortality nor major complications occurred. Mean preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level were 9.7%, 222 mg/dl, 343 mg/dl, and 2.78 ng/ml, respectively. At the sixth postoperative month, HbA1c, FPG, 2-h PPG, and C-peptide level measured 6.7%, 144 mg/dl, 203 mg/dl, and 2.18 ng/ml. Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated the resolution of hyperglycemia in 70% of non-obese T2DM patients (BMI 25-30 kg/m2). Although long-term follow-up data are required, early operative outcomes were satisfactory in terms of glycemic control and safety of the procedure. © 2010 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952192911"

The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects. Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels. Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were RSBP2=0.91, RDBP2=0.89, and RBGL2=0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7% of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B, and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society. Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80052475559"

Totally, 108 subjects (young, the aged with or without diabetes) were recruited from July 2009 to May 2010. Arterial waveform signals from the wrist were obtained and analyzed using HilbertHuang transformation (HHT). Through ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the signals were decomposed into eight intrinsic mode functions (IMF18) of which IMF5 was found to be the desired signal with a discernible diastolic peak. The results showed significant differences in reflection index (RI) and stiffness index (SI) from the young subjects and those from the aged participants with or without diabetes. Significant differences in RI and SI were also noted between subjects with well-controlled diabetes and those without. Good reproducibility and correlation were demonstrated.

However, this method becomes less reliable in the presence of calcified, incompressible arteries, as they result in an erroneously elevated ABI, and an additional measure termed the toe-brachial index (TBI) is recommended. The evaluation of ABI, and in particular TBI, typically requires significant technical skill and often involves referral to a vascular laboratory. This present situation reveals the need for a valid and reliable, automatic, noninvasive device that will provide both ABI and TBI at the level of the primary care physician. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of such a device, the Vasera VS-1500AT, in the assessment of toe, ankle, and brachial systolic blood pressures. Materials and methods: This study involved the assessment of 80 limbs from 40 normotensive and hypertensive individuals (17 men and 23 women) with a mean age of 45±18 years. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation (r=0.92) between toe systolic blood pressures obtained manually with photoplethysmography compared with those obtained through the automated device. The same significant correlation was also seen between the two with ankle (r=0.87) and brachial (r=0.88) systolic blood pressures. Conclusion: These strong correlations demonstrate that further investigation of this device is warranted regarding its use as a screening tool for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease. The automation provided by this device could potentially eliminate variability in these measurements thereby allowing for screening and diagnosis to be done without referral to a vascular laboratory. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79955950237"

Finger, earlobe, nose bridge clamp and forehead sensors have been already used to monitor the functional oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin. Earlobe sensor has a lot of advantages that make it attractive for measuring the hemoglobin concentration and the SaO2. The structure of earlobe enables the application of the theoretical discipline with smaller errors. This may enable the calculation of other blood constituents like glucose. Less disturbance of the patient is achieved for monitoring. In cases of low perfusion, the pulse wave velocity will be affected and the time delay problem will be appeared. But the time delay for the earlobe sensor will be stay smaller than the finger sensor. For motion artifact effect in ambulance overcoming, an adaptive filter is used for reliable measurements. The effect of the motion artifact on the earlobe sensor will be also smaller than on the finger sensor. For long time monitoring and for home use the earlobe sensor consumes less power than the finger sensor. Available reformed light emitting diodes (LEDs) with different wavelengths and especially in the infrared region, where the light absorption of tissue is too high, can be applied by the earlobe clip. The noninvasive measurements are based on the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal which will be studied for the earlobe and the finger sensors under various conditions using Lambert Beer Law (LBL). The difficulties related to the calculations will be also discussed. The study reported that the earlobe sensor can be a suitable sensor under various conditions to calculate the THb concentration and SaO2. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350680661"

In study 1, scending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean±SD age of 54±11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 μg angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40±0.13 to -0.62±0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to - 0.25±0.12 (P<0.001 and P<O.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P<0.001, and r=0.80, P<0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P<0.001, y=0.023x-l.515). The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06±0.36 versus -0.22±0.41, P<0.01). Women had a higher aging index than men (P<0.01). The b-c-d-e/a ratio may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging and for screening of arteriosclerotic disease.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031845575"

Nitroglycerine test of Böhme was carried out estimating the pattern of the so called inclination time before and after sublingual nitroglycerine administration. The capillaries of the diabetic children reacted more strongly to nitroglycerin than those of controls.

Purpose and methods: To estimate the influence of AVF on the blood supply to the hands in the elderly population and to identify steal syndrome cases by non-invasive diagnostics (finger photoplethysmography (PPG), pulse volume recording (PVR), Doppler analysis and pulseoxymetry). The evaluation was carried out in 25 random patients (10 females, 15 males) >75 yrs of age (79.6 ± 3.87 yrs), whose functioning autotogous AVFs had been placed at least 1 month previously. Results: Mean PPG and PVR amplitudes did not differ in statistical analysis (p > 0.05) between hands with and without an AVF. One patient (4%) with end-to-side anastomosis was diagnosed with steal syndrome (typical manifestation confirmed in PPG, Doppler and pulseoxymetry). Two other patients with high brachio-cephalic anastomosis presented subclinical steal syndrome (only low PPG and PVR). Conclusions: Even in the very elderly, AVF creation should be considered due to a lesser influence on the blood supply to the hands. Non-invasive diagnostics used by us seemed to be useful in identifying steal syndrome after AVF creation. © Wichtig Editore, 2005.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-22944474589"

Optical techniques have several advantages over more traditional experimental approaches. Photoplethysmograph (PPG) was one of the earliest methods used for this purpose; PPG satisfies many of the conditions for a non-invasive technique to estimate skin blood flow using infrared light, not only for research but also in clinical practice. PPG is a promising, safe and easy-to-use tool for diagnosis and early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be useful for regular GP-assessment or even self-monitoring of PAD at home or during individual physical exercises. This review discusses the application of PPG in the assessment of PAD. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247153080"

The second derivative wave of the PTG (SDPTG) enables evaluation of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular aging. Responses of SDPTG indices and hemodynamic parameters to anesthesia induction are unknown. A total of 42 patients aged ≥40 years, who may have had atherosclerotic change, and who underwent elective oral surgery, were analyzed. Patients were divided into sevoflurane (S group; N=22) and sevoflurane with remifentanil (R group; N=20) groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR) and SDPTG were measured at four time points: before induction, after loss of consciousness, after tracheal intubation and 30 min after induction. At postintubation, b/a was elevated (that is, large arterial stiffness was increased), and d/a was reduced (that is, peripheral vascular resistance was increased) in the S group compared with the R group. SBP, DBP and HR were increased in the S group compared with those in the R group. In the S group, preanesthetic b/a and the aging index (AGI) were positively correlated with SBP at immediate postintubation, and preanesthetic d/a was negatively correlated with SBP and DBP at immediate postintubation. It is suggested that usage of remifentanil, a potent μ-opioid analgesic, with sevoflurane anesthesia prevented an increase in blood pressure and HR in response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, which was accompanied by suppression of both elevation of b/a and the AGI and reduction of d/a. SDPTG indices are useful for predicting hypertension during induction of sevoflurane anesthesia, regardless of a history of hypertension or hypertensive factors. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856738503"

To measure oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in Indian Mauritians at different stages of development of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Methods. Plasma total 8-epi-PGF2α, an indicator of oxidative stress, was determined in age-matched subjects with normal glucose metabolism (n = 39), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 14), newly diagnosed diabetes (n = 8) and established diabetes (n = 14). Plasma glucose and insulin were measured at base-line and 2 h following an oral glucose tolerance test. Endothelial function was assessed by non-invasive digital pulse wave photoplethysmography. Results. Plasma 8-epi-PGF2α increased in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) compared with control subjects, and was even higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.01) diabetic patients. A tendency towards reduced endothelial function in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance became significant in patients with newly diagnosed and established diabetes (p < 0.01), and was correlated with 8-epi-PGF2α (r=0.36, p < 0.01). Insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment) did not change in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with control subjects, but increased in newly diagnosed (p < 0.01) and established (p < 0.001) diabetic subjects. The 8-epi-PGF2α was correlated with fasting glucose (r = 0.50, p < 0.001), triglycerides (r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). Conclusion/interpretation. Oxidant stress is an early event in the evolution of Type II diabetes and could precede the development of endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034857939"

To prevent the complication due to diabetics it is essential to monitor the blood glucose level continuously. Most of the regular glucose measurement systems are invasive in nature. Invasive methods cause pain, time consumption, high cost and potential risk of spreading infection diseases. Therefore there is a great demand to have reliable cost effective and comfortable non invasive system for the detection of blood glucose level continuously. The proposed method is based on the direct effect of glucose on the scattering properties of the organ. Glucose decreases the mismatch in refractive index between scatterers and their surrounding media, leading to a smaller scattering coefficient and, consequently, a shorter optical path. The reduction in scattering is due to an increase in glucose concentration. As a result, with the growing concentration of glucose, fewer photons are absorbed and the light intensity increases. In the present work, we have used PPG technique. An algorithm was developed from the PPG data for monitoring blood glucose. The result obtained from this technique was compared with ARKRAY, Glucocard tm01-mini and found good agreement. © 2012 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866347176"
